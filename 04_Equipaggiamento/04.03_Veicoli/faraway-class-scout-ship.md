*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

The *Faraway*-Class Scout Ship was an aging model by the time of the Clone Wars. Originally designed as a planetary surveyor for use by mining companies, the ship never caught on and experienced lackluster sales. It saw limited usage by the Republic during the Clone Wars after it was reclassified as a military scout ship. Rothana Heavy Engineering made the mistake of omitting a capable reconnaissance craft from their contract package, creating an opportunity for Subpro. Subpro donated its stockpile of these craft to the Republic for a substantial tax break at a time when the company was struggling financially.

Given the *Faraway's* acceptable track record in the first half of the Clone Wars, Subpro was one company on a short list that the Republic turned to when they required a more aggressive reconnaissance vehicle. One of these ships was used by Obi-Wan during a scouting mission over the planet [Dagro](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dagro), where he was shot down.

### Capabilities
This tiny reconnaissance craft is fitted with an impressive array of sensor equipment. Adapted from a civilian design, the ship is lightly armored and lacks weapons of any kind. The *Faraway*-Class Scout Ship is an attractive find due to the [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) in its stock configuration and its extremely reasonable price. By the time of the Clone Wars, this craft is no longer in production and only obtainable [Used](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Used).
