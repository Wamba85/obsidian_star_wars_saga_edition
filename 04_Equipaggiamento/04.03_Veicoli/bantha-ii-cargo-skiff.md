The Bantha-II is a typical heavy cargo speeder, little more than a platform with a railing around it. Though slow by the standards of most [Speeders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speeders), its simple controls and heavy lifting capacity make it effective as a cargo carrier and mid-range transport. The skiff's open deck makes it easy to load, and its long, lean frame allows it to move into tight spaces and close to loading docks. However, the skiff's large maneuvering vanes, which are easy to damage, make the Bantha-II unpopular for use in crowded cities and on industrialized planets. (The vanes grant anyone not [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) Skill a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) checks with a Bantha-II.)Due to its delicate nature, a Bantha-II always moves -2 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) the first time it takes damage greater than its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). Although the skiffs lack the armor and durability to serve as true military Vehicles, they can be used as troop carriers, moving infantry close to a battle without coming directly under fire. Some crime lords and gangs mount defensive plates and heavy weapons on their skiffs for intimidation purposes (reducing the top speed to 200 kilometers per hour), but these modified skiffs are effective only in nonmilitary conflicts, such as providing cover for smuggler operations or threatening lightly armed civilians. More creative crime lords sometimes add theatrical enhancements, such as extending planks for executions and imposing mastheads of mythical creatures.

Modified versions of the Bantha-II adapt the skiff to the environments of specific worlds. On planets with toxic fumes or dangerous plant life, the skiffs might have enclosed pilothouses and decks to grant life support to passengers. Aquatic skiffs can float on the surface of a lake or river even when unpowered and feature spray-screens to keep passengers dry in a downpour or in whitewater rapids. Skiffs used on desert worlds are equipped with screens and cooling vents to keep them operational during sandstorms.
