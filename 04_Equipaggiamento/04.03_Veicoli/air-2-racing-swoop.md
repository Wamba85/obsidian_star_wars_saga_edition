A design of swoop first introduced by TaggeCo during the Clone Wars, the Air-2 Racing Swoop saw huge sales in its first few decades of production because Podracing had recently been outlawed, replaced on many worlds by swoop racing. Balanced to have just enough power and mass for sport flying, the Air-2 has an impressive top speed of 600 kilometers per hour and a 1-kilometer flight ceiling. The swoop quickly became popular with racers, joyriders, and gang members, but it suffered from an image problem due to its relatively short frame and stubby appearance. When longer, sleeker swoops were introduced as competition, sales of Air-2 declined.

The Air-2 requires skilled piloting. It has controls for both hands and both feet, and the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) must shift their weight to perform many maneuvers. This coordination can be difficult for an unskilled [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) (a character not [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) takes a -2 penalty to [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) checks while operating an Air-2). However, the lack of complex computer controls or Droid parts simplifies repairs, making the swoop popular on harsh planets where more delicate racers suffer regular breakdowns. (An Air-2 grants a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check made to [Repair](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair) or [Jury-Rig](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jury-Rig) it.)

The basic design of the Air-2 Racing Swoop has been copied and modified by dozens of companies; SoroSuub even has a model also called the Air-2. As a result, it's not unusual to find similar swoops with minor differences, such as a second seat for passengers, slightly decreased speed coupled with extra cargo capacity, or heavier armor and a lower flight ceiling. Unlike many other swoop and speeder designs, the Air-2 is almost never armed. Its small size, tricky handling, and lack of spare power make it impossible to mount weapons heavier than pilots can carry on their persons.
