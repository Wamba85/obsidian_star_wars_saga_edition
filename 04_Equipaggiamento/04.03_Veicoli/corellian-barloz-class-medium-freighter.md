At the time of its release, the *Barloz*-Class Medium Freighter is one of the Corellian Engineering Corporation's most lauded models, and it sets the bar for freighters in a number of areas. It is designed during the height of the Republic, and its features reflect the standards of the era. It is a sturdy ship with large cargo holds that are easily customized to accommodate different payloads. *Barloz*-Class Freighters can be modified to carry everything from bacta to foodstuffs. A small number are produced to transport passengers and refugees, but the living conditions aboard these models are cramped and provide few frills.

One of the *Barloz*<nowiki/>'s glaring deficiencies is its stock armament. Its single turret-mounted [Laser Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannon) is adequate during the height of [The Rise of the Empire Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Empire_Era), when the space lanes are relatively safe. With the Galactic Civil War and the chaos that follows, the *Barloz* becomes easy prey for pirates. In addition, the *Barloz* is not particularly comfortable- especially on long voyages.

The focus in freighter design shifts in the later years of the Republic, giving rise to the YT series. The CEC reduces its support of the *Barloz* line in lieu of its newer entries into the marketplace. Though it is marginalized, the *Barloz* continues to see service well into [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era). The *Barloz*<nowiki/>'s inexpensive price tag allows an entire generation of traders, explorers, and smugglers to take to the stars at a time when only the wealthy or indebted can afford to do so.

A series of *Barloz* gunships, known colloquially as Justifiers, are produced by private parties at the height of the Clone Wars. Internal cargo space is converted to make room for larger engines and shield generators, and a number of gun emplacements are added to the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the ship. Intended to provide fire support for merchant shipping, the Justifier is expensive to maintain and is produced only in limited numbers.
