The YZ-775 Medium Transport is considered by the Corellian Engineering Corporation to be one of the largest vessels to be classified as a light freighter and the half step between most [Space Transports](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transports) and actual [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) such as the [CR90 Corellian Corvette](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/CR90_Corellian_Corvette) and the [DP20 Corellian Frigate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/DP20_Corellian_Frigate). Popular with independent cargo haulers and small transport organizations due to its ample cargo hold and sturdy defenses, the YZ-775 can be seen in many starports throughout the galaxy.

Larger than most small freighters (with a length of 52 meters), the ship contains a large cockpit that is easily twice the size of the one found on the [YT-1300 Transport](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/YT-1300_Transport) and has enough room to accommodate the entire eight-person crew. The central section of the ship has two decks: the upper deck is the ship's cargo hold, and the lower deck hosts the living quarters and primary systems. An alternative configuration exchanges the two decks, placing the crew quarters on the upper deck and dedicating the lower deck to cargo. Although the original design provides better security for the ship's cargo, many freighter captains specifically request the alternative configuration, hoping to make loading and unloading cargo much easier at starports and on planets that lack a proper landing zone.

The weapon systems for the YZ-775, seen by Imperial forces as being too numerous for a simple transport not designed for combat, are a welcome sight for independent traders who paid the high price for the ship and do not want to fall prey to pirates and marauders. The Double [Turbolasers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Turbolasers), a weapon system that originally was not approved by the Empire for this ship design, stands as the ship's most powerful weapon and causes many would-be looters to cease their attack. When supplemented by the Double Laser Cannons and [Proton Torpedoes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Torpedoes), many merchant captains flying the YZ-775 rest easier and are seldom bothered by low-level pirates and thieves.

### History
When the Republic transformed into the Empire and people throughout the galaxy learned of the philosophies by which it operated, the pattern of Starship sales changed along with the government. Armed vessels, particularly armed vessels that could be easily modified, suddenly became the type of Starship that buyers most sought.

The Empire, however, was not about to let civilians wield heavy weaponry and began to crack down on shipyards that offered such ships on the open market. The Corellian Engineering Corporation, with its long history and highly respectable reputation of creating ship designs that could fill a wide variety of roles, negotiated with top-ranking officials at the Imperial Bureau of Shipyards and Construction to gain the proper authorizations to continue building armed transports for its civilian clients. Delighted with the uninterrupted flow of products, customers flocked to the CEC's shipyards, further increasing the company's large profit margins.

First introduced to the galaxy a few years after the conclusion of the Clone Wars, the YZ-775 was one of the first class of armed transports to be sold after the CEC gained permission from the Empire to continue its production of such Starships. Sales were remarkably high during its initial years, and the YZ-775 proved to be extremely popular with small trading organizations and independent merchants who could afford the price.

As the years passed and more people grew discontent with the way the Empire ruled the galaxy, many YZ-775s joined the Rebellion's fleet and were used to smuggle weapons and supplies, transport troops, and provide extra firepower. Some vessels survived the war and continued service with [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), despite the apparent age of the ships.

### Corellian YZ-775 Medium Transports in the Galaxy
The YZ-775 is found in starports throughout the galaxy, regardless of its affiliation or location. Since this class of ship is popular with cargo transportation organizations and independent traders that hold no ties to any particular government, it is not uncommon to find a few docked in close proximity to each other at a busy port, offloading cargo or loading new shipments for upcoming stops.

The CEC vehemently denied that the ships of the YZ series were originally intended to be converted to be combat vessels and sold to paramilitary organizations. However, the claims were not taken seriously, especially considering that several star systems in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) that have little to no association with any galactic authority are known to have purchased several YZ-775s to be used specifically as patrol ships or customs vessels. At the same time, other systems have modified a fair number of the ships to bolster their defense fleets against raiders and neighboring systems that seek to expand their control.
