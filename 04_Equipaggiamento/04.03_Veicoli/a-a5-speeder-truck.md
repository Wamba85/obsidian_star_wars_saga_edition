The Speeder Truck is a common sight on numerous worlds, since it's the fastest and most economical way to carry tons of cargo. The Trast Heavy Transport A-A5 Speeder Truck is a typical example of dozens of different heavy cargo speeder designs. It is found on numerous different worlds throughout the Clone Wars, the rise of the New Order, and the Galactic Civil War.

The A-A5 was designed for hard duty on rough worlds, and as such it was covered in heavy armor plates to protect it (and its cargo) from harsh environmental conditions. Its three-person crew cabin makes it perfect for long runs over several days, allowing the crew to drive constantly by sleeping in shifts (two small bunks fold out of the cabin's back wall). Its internal cargo capacity is an impressive 25 tons, and its interior cargo bays have more fold-out benches, allowing the Vehicle to carry twenty-five people securely.

A number of groups, especially militias and insurgents, use A-A5 Speeder Trucks as simple troop transports, depending on their armor and range to move infantry into the thick of battle. Although it serves reasonably well in this capacity, and requires no modifications that would cause it to stick out during an Imperial customs inspection, the A-A5 is not truly tough enough for frontline military duty. Much of its toughness is a result of its size, and though an A-A5 might well survive an attack by infantry troops or even those on [AT-RTs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/AT-RTs), if it faced a similarly sized military vessel (such as an [AT-AT](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/AT-AT)), the A-A5 would be destroyed in moments.
