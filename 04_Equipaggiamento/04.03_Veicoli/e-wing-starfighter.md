*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

Shortly after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), FreiTek was founded by the engineers and scientists who had designed the [X-Wing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing) for Incom. The company's first design, which was supported by the fledgling New Republic, was the E-Wing Starfighter. Given that many of the E-Wing's design team had been involved in Incom's [X-Wing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing) project, the new Starfighter had an excellent pedigree from the very beginning. Expectations were high, especially when the versatility and power of the [X-Wing Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing_Starfighter) were taken into account. 

The E-Wing was originally conceived as a replacement for the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/a-wing-starfighter.md|A-Wing Starfighter]]. Initial trials of the fighter exceeded all expectations, since it was fast, well armed, and quite agile. After a time, problems with the design of the E-Wing's weapon lasers became obvious, requiring that they be redesigned. The result was the Type B E-Wing. Though it is still host to a few minor technical issues, the Type B is a solid design that continues to be a favorite among New Republic fighter pilots. 

Though they are available only in small numbers, E-Wings have nonetheless been distinguished in combat several times. They have seen service against the remnants of the Imperial Navy as lead by Grand Admiral Thrawn, during the Black Fleet Crisis, and in the Yuuzhan Vong War. Given the expense of these Starfighters, as well as their advanced capabilities, they are almost always flown by ace pilots. 

### Capabilities
The E-Wing is extremely maneuverable due to its innovative control surfaces. These systems are inherently tied to the ship's Astromech Droid, which must be installed for them to function at peak efficiency. To make matters somewhat more complicated, the E-Wing isn't able to employ standard Astromech Droids unless they are retrofitted (At a cost of 10,000 credits). The [R7-Series Astromech Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/R7-Series_Astromech_Droid) is the standard for which the E-Wing was designed, and it can be used with no modifications whatsoever. So long as the ship is equipped with an R7 (Or sufficiently modified) Astromech Droid, the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) benefits from a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) checks.
