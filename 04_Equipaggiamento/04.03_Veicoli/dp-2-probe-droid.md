*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scavenger's Guide to Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scavenger's_Guide_to_Droids)*

Even before the advent of [The Mandalorian Wars](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorian_Wars) and [The Jedi Civil War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Civil_War), Duwani Mechanical Products produced a vast number of Droids for many facets of society. With a good portion of space still unexplored, Duwani created a Probe Droid for the scouts and explorers that roam the galaxy. The DP-2 has an ovoid body with a face at one end and six arms that extend away at equidistant points around the middle of the chassis. The arms give the Droid the appearance of constantly being in flight, even when it is motionless. The front end of the chassis hosts a highly sensitive sensor suite designed to scan for biological, chemical, and electromagnetic signatures as well as for various forms of life. The arms hold different tools that the DP-2 uses to collect samples and specimens when exploring new worlds. In the event that the DP-2 is used to track a course or guide its master to a destination, it contains a [Space-Beacon Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space-Beacon_Launcher) system that can deploy up to 16 beacons. The Droid also carries a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-cannon.md|Blaster Cannon]] in case it encounters hostile lifeforms during its journey. 
### Extended Travels
*The DP-2 Probe Droid that Duwani Mechanical Products built was quite popular in its day. I'm surprised they didn't put all the scouts out of business. Those Droids were pretty good at what they did. I suppose that's why Duwani didn't equip them with [Hyperdrives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrives). If they did that, we wouldn't need Starships anymore, eh? We could just send DP-2s out to deliver our messages or find new planets for us to colonize. But I suppose that some people would still want to travel the stars, and I would be glad for that- so I could sell them some of my other Droids. You know, now that you mention it, friend, there's this customer of mine who flew off to [Dantooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dantooine). Something happened when he reached the system. I got a message from him saying that some Droid shot out his engines when he approached one of the outer planets, and now he's drifting, caught in the planet's gravity well. The description of the Droid he gave me sure sounds like a DP-2. Maybe you could go rescue him and bring him back here? He still owes me credits.*

### Encountering a DP-2 Probe Droid
Most often, a DP-2 Probe Droid is found performing an initial assessment of a newly discovered world, scouting ahead for its master while on a planet, or staying within line of sight of its master while it watches their camp's perimeter. In this encounter, a DP-2 Probe Droid patrols the edge of its master's camp in the middle of a large, grassy field on a temperate world. The Droid floats along at a leisurely but steady pace at a distance of about 20 squares from the camp when the heroes arrive. When the DP-2 detects them, it alerts its master and his companions before bringing its [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-cannon.md|Blaster Cannon]] to bear and demanding the reason for the heroes' presence. If they do not give a sufficient answer within 1 round, the Droid warns them to turn back or it will open fire. If the heroes do not leave, the Droid intentionally fires at the ground in front of them to try to scare them away. The DP-2 expects its master and up to three of his friends to arrive within 2 rounds to back it up.

#### **Modification: Blockade Breaker**
If the situation ever arises where one is stuck behind a planetary blockade and escape seems hopeless, this modification of the DP-2 Probe Droid just might do the trick. The idea is to send the droid ahead to distract the blockade from noticing the Starship carrying those trying to escape. Preparing the Droid for such a task is not difficult and takes little more than a day. The first and probably most important part of the process is removing the [Space-Beacon Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space-Beacon_Launcher) and replacing it with [Starship Shields](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Shields) (SR 25) to increase the odds that the Droid will survive the encounter. Installing the system requires a DC 35 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check, 4 hours of work, and raw materials worth 1,500 credits.

To make sure that sufficient power is available for the shield generator, add a [Secondary Battery](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Secondary_Battery) dedicated entirely to that purpose (a task requiring 4 hours of work and raw materials worth 1,000 credits). Finally, adding [Maneuvering Jets](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maneuvering_Jets) helps the Droid avoid incoming fire and improves its ability to successfully pilot through the blockade; this process requires 8 hours of work, costs 2,000 credits, and gives the Droid a +2 bonus to its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) score.

#### **Modification: Coutier Droid**
Sometimes, cargo needs to be delivered to a recipient, but the sender wants to keep his or her identity secret or avoid possible hostile reactions to the package. Configuring a DP-2 Probe Droid to deliver the package is a good way to accomplish such a task. To modify the DP-2 Droid in this manner, start by removing the [Space-Beacon Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space-Beacon_Launcher) and installing 20 kilograms of [Compartment Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Compartment_Space) in its place. Replace the Droid's sublight drive with one that increases its speed to 4 or 5 squares to improve its chance of reaching its destination in a timely manner- and to reduce the risk that the Droid will be stopped by forces seeking to intercept it. Installing a [Holographic Image Disguiser](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Holographic_Image_Disguiser) can help the Droid fool observers into thinking that it is nothing more than a meteor or a piece of space junk. Finally, adding a [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) allows the DP-2 to journey to other star systems, which further helps its master avoid entanglements.

The entire cost of this modification is 31,300 credits. The entire modification can be done in 2 days with a single DC 35 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check. The end result is that the Droid has a sublight speed of 4 squares ([Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale)), a [Holographic Image Disguiser](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Holographic_Image_Disguiser), a Class 8 [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), and 20 kg of [Compartment Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Compartment_Space).

DP-2 Probe Droid can't be played as [Droid Heroes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Heroes).
