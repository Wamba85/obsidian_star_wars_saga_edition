*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

The AA-9 Freighter-Liner is originally used as a heavy cargo freighter. However, in the years preceding the Clone Wars, many beings attempted to flee their homes as [The Confederacy of Independent Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems) imposed debilitating tariffs and all-out embargos on their worlds. Planets still under the authority of the Republic such as [Alderaan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaan), [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant), and [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo) attempted to cope with the strain brought on by the massive influx of immigrants by spearheading the Refugee Relief Movement.

Various planetary governments, with the aid of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic), purchased as many AA-9 Freighters as possible and speedily retrofitted them to serve as passenger transports to ferry the thousands of refugees to their new homes. The once spacious cargo decks contained within the 129 meters of the AA-9 acts as crowded steerage for some 30,000 refugees who sought sanctuary on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) and other worlds.

One such vessel, The *Jendirian Valley*, transported an undercover Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala back to the senator's home planet of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo), after several assassination attempts forced Amidala from her seat in the Senate and into hiding. Another example of the retooled cargo ship was The *Star of Iskin*, which was destroyed in the second year of the Clone Wars; its obliteration killed thousands onboard and on the ground below when [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/anzati.md|Anzati]] assassin Sajé Tashe caused the explosion to cover up her assassination of Supreme Chancellor Valorum. The destruction of The *Star of Iskin* causes the creation and implementation of the Enhanced Security and Enforcement Act.

### Capabilities
During the Clone Wars, and for decades after, the AA-9 Freighter-Liner retrofit is just as common as the stock freighter model. It has been fitted with [Environmental Filters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Environmental_Filters) to accommodate as many different [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) as possible. The original Freighter model carries only ten passengers and holds 150,000 tons of cargo.
