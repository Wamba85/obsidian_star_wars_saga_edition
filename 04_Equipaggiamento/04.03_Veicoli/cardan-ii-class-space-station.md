The *Cardan*-Class Space Station started as a simple defense platform designed to defend strategic locations from anyone not authorized by the Empire to be present. Able to be deployed either in orbit just outside a planet's atmosphere or positioned in deep space, the station provides front-line defense against any forces attempting to reach whatever the station is guarding. These stations can be found throughout the galaxy at locations that hold some importance to the Empire.
*Cardan*-Class Space Stations are built in five sizes and labeled accordingly, from Mark I to Mark V. The smallest, Mark I, has the fewest defense capabilities and is typically positioned at locations not needing too much security, such as low-level scientific research facilities and agricultural colonies. A Mark V, on the other hand, is a strong, military station with enough defenses to hold back an entire fleet of warships and is usually found protecting highly classified sites. The station is designed to be somewhat modular in construction, with various sections dedicated to a particular purpose. Each section focuses on a single purpose, such as Starship repair and construction or communications. At the same time, attaching a new section increases the facility's defense strength by adding more weapons and [TIE Fighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/TIE_Fighter) squadrons, making it more formidable than before.Although each section is different in function from the others, they all share similar architectural aspects. Each one features smooth, angular structures and long rows of windows, giving an impression that the station has been lifted from a section of [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) and launched into space. At least one hangar bay filled with a minimum of one [TIE Fighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/TIE_Fighter) squadron can be found in each section along with housing facilities for the ships' pilots and technicians.

The shipyard integrated into the larger-level stations hosts facilities that provide some of the best quality work in the Empire and a valuable resource for the Imperial fleet when deployed away from [The Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core_Worlds), something other Imperial defense stations such as the Golan Defense Platform do not provide. Despite the fact that the Golan Defense Platform is capable of providing a stronger defense, the repair facilities provided by the *Cardan*-Class Space Station help keep the Imperial fleet positioned far from the galactic core in prime condition.

Large enough to allow an [*Imperial I*-Class Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyer) to drydock, the shipyards are capable of building a [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship) from the ground up or repairing ships with the same care. In addition to the drydocks, smaller hangar bays large enough to allow up to four additional [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) to park are also available.

Since the stations' shipyards are a valuable resource for the Imperial fleet while away from [The Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core_Worlds), finding at least one or two ships in close proximity to the base is not uncommon. In times of crisis, station personnel can request aid from these nearby vessels that quickly come to the center's defense, and one or two [*Acclamator II*-Class Assault Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acclamator_II-Class_Assault_Ships) or [*Tartan*-Class Patrol Cruisers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tartan-Class_Patrol_Cruisers) are usually the first to arrive on the scene.

Station security keeps a watchful eye over each hangar bay from a surveillance center at each location along the top of one of the hangar's walls, which also houses the traffic controllers and control systems for the bay. The station's internal security also centers its operations from these centers, allowing security officers to deal with any situations within the station quickly and efficiently.

The defenses of the *Cardan I*-Class Space Station hardly seem sufficient for its duties as an orbital or deep space defense platform, but they have proven capable of defending the station from small groups of pirates foolish enough to attack. With higher-level stations, the defenses increase dramatically, to the point that whole war fleets have difficulty breaching the defense grid.

Although the station's guns can prove to be quite a match for any intruders, the addition of the station's fighter complement can cause some of the strongest starship captains to turn tail and run. Some *Cardan V* stations have been known to house as many as eight [TIE Fighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/TIE_Fighter) squadrons at any given time.

### History
The *Cardan*-Class Space Station was initially conceived during the latter part of the Clone Wars as a means of additional planetary defense against Separatist fleets that encroached on Republic worlds. Initial prototypes were completed by Kuat Drive Yards, and full production began by the time the war ended, but the stations were not deployed until well after the Empire had fully replaced the Republic as the galaxy's primary government.

*Cardan I*-Class stations were introduced into service first and placed throughout the Empire to help maintain order and defend outlying systems from pirates and mercenaries seeking to intrude on Imperial systems. Praise was high after the first reports of success flooded into the halls of the Imperial military. But when these stations started being overrun by larger criminal organizations, KDY quickly supplemented them with newer and larger structures, increasing the defensive power. Many fledgling groups of bandits and even some larger crime rings decided that engaging these stations was too much of a risk and backed off, letting larger factions take their chances against the stations.

The stations' success helped Kuat Drive Yards develop bigger and better facilities for themselves and the Empire, helping to improve the plans for future Starships and stations, such as the [Super Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Star_Destroyer) and the second Death Star. 

### *Cardan II*-Class Space Stations in the Galaxy
*Cardan*-Class Space Stations can be found in almost every Imperial star system from [The Deep Core](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Deep_Core) to the edge of the galaxy, but a higher concentration is evident in [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim) and [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories). As the Empire stretches its influence to more and more star systems in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) and garrisons are planted on new worlds, new stations are established to help cement the Empire's presence and maintain its control in the area. Also, *Cardan*-Class stations can be found at strategically important points in deep space, such as the Hyperspace crossroads where the Perlemian Trade Route and the Hydian Way intersect.

### Tactical Fire
The *Cardan*-Class Space Station performs very well not only at defending its immediate area but also at keeping the ships that visit in excellent condition. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Cardan II*-Class Space Station can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 3-square radius around itself.
