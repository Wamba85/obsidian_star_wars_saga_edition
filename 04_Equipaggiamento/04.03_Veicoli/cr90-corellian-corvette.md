The Corellian Corvette is the logical step up from the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/corellian-yt-1300-transport.md|Corellian YT-1300 Transport]]- a larger configurable space vessel for larger jobs. The Corellian Corvette can serve as a cargo transport, a passenger liner, a trooper ship, or an escort. Corellian Corvettes frequently find their way into civilian use, and a significant number fall into the hands of pirates.

## Additional CR90 Corellian Corvette Data
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

One of the most common and popular vessels produced by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, the CR90 Corellian Corvette serves multiple purposes in fleets of all types throughout the galaxy. A smaller [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship) that is just a step up from a [Space Transport](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transport), the CR90 Corvette is large enough to carry a significant complement of passengers or troops while requiring a relatively small crew to operate.

Durable vessels that complement any battle group (and, indeed, they are often seen in Rebel and pirate fleets), many CR90 Corvettes are owned by individuals and private organizations. Often referred to as blockade runners, these ships boast a distinctive "Hammerhead" design that is recognizable almost anywhere in the galaxy.

### Capabilities
Though excellent as consulars or transport ships, CR90 Corvettes also see extensive use as military and pirate vessels. Most CR90 Corvettes are easily modified (a common trait among many of the ships produced by the Corellian Engineering Corporation), and as such they can be tailored to a specific owner's needs. The ease with which CR90 Corvettes are modified makes adding weaponry, shielding, and even secondary hull plating a simple matter, meaning that aftermarket modifications that boost the ship's offensive capability are among the most common upgrades made to the vessel. Pirates, gunrunners, shipjackers, and smugglers favor the CR90 Corvette because even a heavily modified ship can appear innocuous at first glance, making it easy to launch surprise attacks on unsuspecting targets (or sneak past the watchful eyes of the authorities).

CR90 Corvettes often see use in small-scale naval skirmishes, such as breaking planetary blockades. In fact, many planetary defense fleets use CR90 Corvettes to breach enemy lines and set up flanking maneuvers. Since the ship's configuration can be changed to suit a variety of roles (including naval combat, escort, troop carrier, and cargo hauler), these ships are often considered dynamic assets, allowing their owners to get greater use out of the ship when compared to more static vessels. As such, they are highly valued in both military and civilian roles (and can often shift between the two over the course of a single ship's lifetime).
