*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

Designed by Rendili StarDrive in the waning days of the Republic, the *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser is a heavily armed battleship that remains in active use despite being supplanted by superior technologies. The *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser came into service well before the beginning of the Clone Wars, but by the time the conflict arrived it had already become outdated. The newer ships, developed specifically for galaxywide warfare, quickly outstripped the *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser in both power and reliability, but despite this fact the bulky heavy cruiser was a mainstay of the Republic fleet.

During the Clone Wars, most *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruisers were operated by volunteers or planetary defense forces, not clones. The high number of crewmembers required to operate a *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser made it a huge drain on personnel; however, the Republic chose to man these ships with volunteers, reserving their more advanced ships for their specially trained clone units and highly loyal officers. The *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser continues to be found in service all throughout the galaxy; though the ship is considered antiqued at best, it boasts an armament that, despite its age, is not to be trifled with.

### Capabilities
The *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser's lack of shielding (compared to more cutting-edge [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships), such as the [*Imperial I*-Class Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyer)) is offset by its general toughness, meaning that if a shot gets through, it is less likely to reduce the ship's capabilities even if it destroys a large chunk of the ship. Most *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruisers were built with multiple redundant systems, allowing them to fight on despite suffering serve hits to certain parts of the ship.

As a result, many *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruisers are used as shields to protect more delicate ships, soaking up damage that would devastate a smaller vessel. The *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser's smaller size (compared to the [*Imperial I*-Class Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyer) and its ilk) makes it less intimidating than other [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships), but its sturdiness and reliability more than compensates for this drawback.

### Tactical Fire
The *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser is designed to absorb damage intended for other, adjacent, [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) by interposing itself between the target ship and its attackers. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 2-square radius around itself. Any attacks targeting allied ships of Colossal (Frigate) size or larger within that area are automatically directed at the *Dreadnaught*-Class Heavy Cruiser instead.
