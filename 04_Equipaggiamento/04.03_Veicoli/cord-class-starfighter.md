*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

When the Republic accepted their Clone Army created by the [Kaminoans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kaminoans), they unwittingly entered into contracts with several corporations to supply their army with material. The largest of these corporations was a subsidiary of Kuat Drive Yards called Rothana Heavy Engineering, who manufactured nearly all the [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) utilized by the clones during the early period of the war. One such design was the *Cord*-Class Starfighter. The high-speed interceptors were thrown in because Rothana found itself with a massive fleet of the ships after a few backwater planetary defense forces defaulted on their loans, forcing Rothana to repossess the fighters. The fact that they were used contributed to their exceptionally low price, and allowed Rothana to clear out an undesirable overstock of a low-grade product. Rothana Heavy Engineering was led to believe the Starfighters were fairly unimportant when compared to the versatility of the LAAT series of transports and the already impressive Jedi Starfighters created by their parent company on Kuat.

The Republic quickly learned that their doctrine had to focus more on quality than quantity, since their pilots were not stamped out in factories by the thousands. The under-performing *Cord* was quickly phased out in favor of the [V-19 Torrent Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/V-19_Torrent_Starfighter), which in turn was later replaced by the more specialized [V-Wing Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/V-Wing_Starfighter) and [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/arc-170-starfighter.md|ARC-170 Starfighter]]. What few *Cord*s remained after the Clone Wars found their way into poor planetary defense forces and pirate bands. The large cargo area meant that it also found a home among specialized smugglers, who were able to modify the craft with a [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) to transport small quantities of highly-lucrative contraband past blockades and customs. The *Cord*-Class Starfighter most notably distinguished itself at the Battle of [Raxus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Raxus), where it escorted Republic Gunships to landing zones. 

### Capabilities
The *Cord*-Class Starfighter may not be the most high-performance [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) in the galaxy, but it is quite a bargain. Its respectable speed and maneuverability allow it to project its power quickly onto a battlefield, often allowing the fighter to dictate the pace of battle. However, the *Cord*-Class is fragile, and under-armed. To ensure adequate firepower and protection, it’s typically deployed in units of at least four, and more commonly eight or twelve. Republic military advisors considered the craft a waste of resources and soon opted for the much more durable, armed and agile [V-19 Torrent Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/V-19_Torrent_Starfighter), increasing the survivability of trained pilots dramatically.
