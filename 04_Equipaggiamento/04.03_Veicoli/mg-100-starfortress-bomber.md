*MG-100 StarFortress Bomber Starship data created by reddit user sparktrace.*

The MG-100 StarFortress Bomber is slow, bulky, and ungainly, but it is uniquely suited to dropping several metric tons of powerful explosive on whatever target it sets its sights on. Built by Slayn & Korpil in the last years of the Galactic Civil War, the MG-100 saw only a short run in the New Republic's navy before demilitarization sent the majority to the scrapyards.

However, many were sold to private owners or companies, for use in mining, cargo transport, rescue missions, and other civilian ventures. As [The Resistance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Resistance) arose to oppose the depredations of [The First Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_First_Order), they managed to acquire a few squadrons of aging StarFortresses, which they used against [The First Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_First_Order) with a decent success rate. After the disastrous loss of Cobalt and Crimson squadrons at the evacuation of [D'Qar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/D'Qar), the bombers were modified to make them more viable in frontline combat, known as the Ambush Refit.

### Capabilities
The MG-100 is a sluggish bomber, and does not function well without escort. The stock version relies on its forward, ventral, and rear turrets for weaponry, with the rest of the craft's armament coming from the modular "Clip" bomb bay attached to the ventral vane. This bay is usually fitted with [Proton Bombs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Bombs) and electromagnetic launch rails, but clips with different loadouts or systems can be easily attached.

The statistics presented here represents a standard bombing clip, with the [Proton Bombs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Bombs) attack being a small release of 10 or so bombs at a time. By dropping all at once, the bombardier makes an attack roll at +7 and dealing 16d10x5 on a successful hit, expending the entire bomb magazine in one devastating move.

### Ambush Refit
Recognizing that the MG-100 was too slow and vulnerable for the frontline role it otherwise excelled at, Resistance engineers put together an upgrade package to make it more combat-viable. This includes a SLAM system and a shield upgrade, costing 100,000 credits, and uses all 4 unused [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points). However, the two systems draw too much power to use simultaneously.

An MG-100 StarFortress Bomber with an Ambush Refit has a [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating) of 100, but this drops to SR 20 while the SLAM system is active. While the SLAM is active, the MG-100's base speed is increased to 3 squares ([Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale)). StarFortress Bombers with an Ambush Refit have a CL of 12.

### Alternative Loadouts
If an MG-100 StarFortress Bomber is needed for a non-bombing mission, alternative clips are available which provide different payloads and systems. New or replacement clips cost 20,000 credits. Any time the StarFortress moves down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), any systems in the clip are disabled until it moves back up the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). A few sample pods are detailed below:

- **Bomb Rack:** Hold up to 1048 [Proton Bombs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Bombs), which can be dropped a few at a time, or all at once.
- **Cargo Hold:** Contains up to 100 tons of general cargo in racks, as well as an emergency [Cargo Jettison System](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cargo_Jettison_System).
- **Troop Transport:** Outfitted with rack and stack jumpseats for up to 40 troops, and a small medical bay at the top of the clip.
- **Missile Platform:** Contains 10 optional Fire-Linked [Proton Torpedo Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Torpedo_Launchers), 2 [Shieldbuster Torpedo Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shieldbuster_Torpedo_Launchers), and two [Concussion Missile Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion_Missile_Launchers), with a total payload of 60 [Proton Torpedoes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Torpedoes), 10 [Shieldbuster Torpedoes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shieldbuster_Torpedoes), and 20 [Armor-Piercing Concussion Missiles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor-Piercing_Concussion_Missiles).
- **Scout Unit:** Contains a +4 [Sensor Array Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sensor_Array_Computer), a [Sensor Enhancement Package](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sensor_Enhancement_Package), [Hypertransceiver](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hypertransceiver), one month's consumables, and quarters for for the crew during long-term recon missions.
