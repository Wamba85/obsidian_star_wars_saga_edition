The Cracian Thumper is the galaxy's most widely used land [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount). Originally a native of all five planets in the Craci System, the Thumper has been exported to most civilized systems of the galaxy. It is used as a versatile [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount) for military operations by [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance), and as a racing [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount) by residents of more urban areas. A Cracian Thumper is bipedal, with powerful hind limbs, smaller forelimbs, and a thick tail it uses for balance and defense. Thick, long fur covers its body in colder climates, but is shed on warmer planets. Racing Thumpers are typically shaved to reduce weight and to give the creatures a sleeker appearance.

The Beast is known for its agility, intelligence, and versatility; however, above all else, Thumpers are known for their stealth. Cracian Thumpers have large feet that cause most observers to mistakenly anticipate that the creatures will make loud, thumping sounds as they run. On the contrary, the Thumper is exceptionally quiet and makes an excellent [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount) for stealthy land operations.

Although they are herbivores, Cracian Thumpers possess potent defenses: sharply clawed front and rear limbs, and a powerful tail. Thumpers are capable of lashing out with their rear claws without breaking stride, or of knocking the heads off of unlucky [Stormtroopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtroopers) with their muscular tails.

For animals, Cracian Thumpers are also fairly intelligent. They are easily trained for a variety of uses and are particularly good at recognizing simple patterns; for example, the Rebellion teaches their Thumpers that humanoid shapes in hard, all-white shells are the enemy. A Thumper is typically assigned one rider as a trainer in order to take advantage of the creature's naturally loyal disposition.
