The 105-K Lancer Bike is a fairly standard Swoop Bike produced by Aratech Repulsor Company, and was purchased and modified in small batches to form a small division of armored cavalry for special circumstances. It was thought that simple Droids marching in columns would be vulnerable to flanking attacks by the quick swoops armed with [Verpine Power Lances](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Verpine_Power_Lances). During the Battle of [Muunilist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Muunilist), Jedi General Kenobi saw how vulnerable his own [SPHA-T](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/SPHA-T) Walkers were to the same tactic before deploying his 105-K-mounted Clone Troopers to engage. Obi-Wan rode one of these bikes, wielding his [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/lightsaber-weapon.md|Lightsaber]] instead of the standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/verpine-power-lance.md|Verpine Power Lance]].
### Capabilities
As a swoop, the 105-K is capable of reaching altitudes of up to 105 meters. While not technically attached to the swoop itself, the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/verpine-power-lance.md|Verpine Power Lance]] is standard issue for all Republic mounted cavalry units, and one lance is included in the price of the swoop.

Upon a successful hit with the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/verpine-power-lance.md|Verpine Power Lance]], as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), the attacker can choose to spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to depress the firing stud that activates a secondary damage mode. This damage is determined by what type of tip was previously mounted on the lance, and can either do 2d6 [Ion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion) damage, 3d8 Energy damage from a blaster bolt, or 4d10 Energy damage from an explosive charge. This additional damage can only be activated once per tip (with the exception of the blaster bolt tip, which carries 3 charges), at which point the charge is permanently expended. Replacement lance heads cost 200 credits and requires 1d6+2 rounds to switch out.

During a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) that results in a Critical Hit, a medium or smaller target becomes impaled on the lance, immediately moving -2 steps down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), and the target moves with the swoop until they succeed at a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check with the lance wielder. The lance's secondary attack cannot be engaged if a target is impaled, and no further attacks against the impaled target can be made with the lance until they are freed. Each subsequent round that the impaled target fails the [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check, they remain impaled and incur an additional 1d10 damage, and move -1 step further down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). Large or greater targets cannot be impaled.

Upon critical failure or on an attack roll where the result ties the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), damage is still dealt, but the tip is considered to have broken and the bonus damage charge are unable to be used, and the weapon is unusable for attacks until the lance head is replaced. One replacement lance head is typically kept in the cargo storage, which is accessible only when the Lancer Bike is stopped.
