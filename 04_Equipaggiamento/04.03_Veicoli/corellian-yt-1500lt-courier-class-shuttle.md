*Corellian YT-1500LT *Courier*-Class Shuttle data created by reddit user Just_Michael1138.*

The Corellian Engineering Corporation's answer to high-end shuttles such as the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/baudo-class-star-yacht.md|*Baudo*-Class Star Yacht]] and [*Theta*-Class Shuttle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Theta-Class_Shuttle), the YT-1500LT *Courier*-Class Shuttle was designed for customers who live out beyond [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim) and want to travel safely in style and comfort without having to break their bank account to do so.

Each ship is made to order, with CEC's usual wide variety of paint, decor, and entertainment options available. This gives the *Courier*-Class the hand-crafted feel for which it has fast become famous for. There is a waiting list for delivery of these ships as a result, with the average wait time being around a year.

The YT-1500LT features several radical new design elements, including a forward-facing docking ring, and a cockpit that sits above and aft of the ship. Furthermore, the cockpit itself can detach from the ship in an emergency and act as an [Escape Pod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_Pod) for the crew.

Upon entering the ship, one is enveloped in luxury, equivalent to an Advanced [Luxury Upgrade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luxury_Upgrade). Exotic wood paneling covers the walls lit softly by recessed lighting behind crash-pads upholstered in bantha calf leather. The main hold features a leather grav-couch, a holo-table programmed for numerous functions including dejarik, a state-of-the-art home theater system with a large view screen, and a galley appointed with high-end appliances. The passenger quarters feature carpeted floors, exotic wood armoires, and a large, ceiling-mounted holo-projector. The *Courier*-Class also comes equipped with a [Hypertransceiver](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hypertransceiver) so that business can continue uninterrupted from anywhere in the galaxy.

Although the *Courier*-Class Shuttle, unlike other YT-series ships, has only 5 Emplacement Points, the ship is so well-rounded that most owners opt to use them to improve its [Luxury Upgrade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luxury_Upgrade) or extend its range. Combining CEC's reputation for solid engineering and functionality with Corellian style and luxury, the YT-1500LTs are fast becoming a very popular entry in the personal/business-class shuttle market.

### Capabilities
The Corellian YT-1500LT *Courier*-Class Shuttle is surprisingly robust for a shuttle, and features a ventral turret pod to fend off enemy [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters) while its powerful shields can absorb any laser-fire it can't dodge. Furthermore, the shuttle also features a controversial series of high-speed [Combat Thrusters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Thrusters), giving it exceptional maneuverability against [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships).

This has raised more than a few eyebrows among Imperial officials, who claim that CEC engineered the YT-1500LT to be able to avoid [Imperial Customs Corvettes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Customs_Corvettes). CEC's team of attorneys, however, contend that the *Courier*-Class was designed for customers who live beyond [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim), where Imperial "protection" is often lacking entirely. To date, no legal action has been taken against CEC by Imperial authorities, and the *Courier*-Class Shuttle continues to be built in large numbers.

The YT-1500 also comes in a "freight" configuration popular among long-haulers and other shady types, and is cheaper than the standard version (125,000 (80,000 [Used](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Used))). The YT-1500FP is a stripped-down version, lacking the [Luxury Upgrade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luxury_Upgrade) and [Hypertransceiver](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hypertransceiver) but gaining an additional 2 [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points) (for a total of 7).
