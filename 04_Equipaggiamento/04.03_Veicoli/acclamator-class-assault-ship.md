*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

The *Acclamator*-Class Assault Ship, produced by Rothana Heavy Engineering for Kamino's cloners, quickly became a staple of the Old Republic's clone legions. Produced on a scale to match that of the [Clone Troopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Troopers) it was designed to carry, dozens of the ships were crewed and ready to depart when Jedi Master Yoda arrived to mobilize an invasion force. Though formidable in appearance, the ships had never been tested in battle. Given the *Acclamator's* role as the primary delivery system for ground forces, the entire conflict hinged on its ability to survive under combat conditions.

The *Acclamator* saw its baptism of fire during the invasion of [Geonosis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosis). A small number of the assault ships were lost to ground fire following the deployment of troops to the planet surface, but the casualties were deemed acceptable. Those that remained pulled back to provide orbital fire support. By the end of the first day, the Separatist forces were scattered and in complete retreat. The *Acclamator* had proved its worth and stood as a chilling omen of the Star Destroyers that would eventually take its place.

Following the Clone Wars, the *Acclamator* was replaced in service by newer, larger, and more powerful ships, such as the [*Victory I*-Class Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyers), and the [*Imperial I*-Class Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyers). The *Acclamators* that remained in Imperial service were regulated to duty in rear-echelon areas. Scattered reports reveal that *Acclamators* were used as transports for prisoners and slaves following the beginning of the rebellion against the Empire, but these rumors are difficult to confirm. Many of the venerable assault ships were eventually decommissioned and stripped, their hulls broken down and recycled by Kuat Drive Yards in order to produce newer and more terrifying weapons.

### Capabilities
The *Acclamator* is designed as a legion-level troop transport. Using exceptionally efficient Hyperdrive engines, an assault ship is capable of traversing the vastness of space in a short amount of time. In addition to 16,000 Clone Troopers, a typical *Acclamator* carries 48 [AT-TEs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/AT-TE), 80 [LAAT/i Gunships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/LAAT/i_Gunships), 36 [SPHAs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/SPHAs), and 320 [Speeder Bikes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speeder_Bikes). Once a force is deployed, the assault ship has the capacity to function as an orbital command center.

In dire situations, several *Acclamators* could join forces to perform an [Orbital Bombardment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Orbital_Bombardment) designed to eradicate all factors of production (including all sentients). Codenamed Base Delta Zero by Old Republic Confederacy, and (later) Imperial forces, such a technique was sparingly used against systems that were too rebellious to be conquered.

If the *Acclamator* has one weakness, it is its overspecialization as a ground attack platform. Though it can certainly defend itself from small spaceborne threats, it doesn't have the staying power or flexibility to stand against a concerted attack by [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships). It for this reason, more than any other, that the *Acclamator* design was eventually abandoned by the Empire in favor of larger, less specialized vessels.
