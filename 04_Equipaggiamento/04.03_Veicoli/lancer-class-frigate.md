*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

After the Imperial defeat at the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), Naval Command developed the *Lancer*-Class Frigate as an antifighter escort for larger ships that might be susceptible to the Alliance's [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) tactics. Although it is the size of a light cruiser, the *Lancer*-Class was designed to destroy small ships at close range. Early *Lancers* were plagued with severe fire control malfunctions that could shut down more than half of the ship's [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons), making the craft less than useless.

Overall, the *Lancer*-Class was eventually considered a failure by Imperial command. Because the ship was too expensive to see much more than sporadic deployment within the Imperial Fleet, the majority of *Lancers* are assigned to planetary defense  and rear guard actions. Despite this, Grand Admiral Thrawn employed the *Lancer's* capabilities to excellent effect, using them to raid New Republic worlds that were largely equipped with [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter)-based defenses.

Though no specific *Lancers* in the Imperial Navy have distinguished themselves, one frigate- captured by [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance)- has been made famous by its success. The *Fowler*, a late-model *Lancer*-Class captured by Alliance forces near [Malastare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Malastare), was put into service as an anti-[TIE Fighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/TIE_Fighter) platform. Retrofitted with an improved [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), The *Fowler* was sent on strike missions, providing cover for [Y-Wing Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Y-Wing_Starfighters). In its role as an antistarfighter platform, the Rebel *Lancer* racked up an impressive number of kills, surviving long enough to be decommissioned after the formation of [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic).

### Capabilities
Because it is slower than its intended targets, the *Lancer*-Class Frigate is unable to actively seek out and engage enemy [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters) on its own. Instead, it is used by the Empire as a picket vessel, deployed on the outskirts of a fleet's perimeter. The ship's excellent capabilities in an antistarfighter role are perhaps its greatest weakness when it comes against [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships). The relatively light [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons) it is equipped with cannot compete with the armor and shields of [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships). Likewise, the range of capital-scale weaponry far exceeds that of the weapons the *Lancer*-Class employs, thus guaranteeing that it is an easy target when pitted against them.

### Tactical Fire
The *Lancer*-Class Frigate is exceptionally good at punching through enemy Starfighters' defenses, weakening their shields so that allied fighters can finish them off. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Lancer*-Class Frigate can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all adjacent squares. Enemy Starships of Gargantuan size and smaller have their [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating) halved while within these squares.
