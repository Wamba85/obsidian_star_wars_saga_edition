The Freerunner is a heavy military speeder designed by KAAC (the Kelliak Arms and Armor Company) to be the ultimate in fast, flexible military ground craft. Its advertising claims it's able to take on advanced scout, supply escort, or even frontline combat duties. Its development just after the Clone Wars is a case of bad timing, however, since the Empire has already decided to move to [Walkers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Walkers) and [Tracked Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tracked_Vehicles). With no major contracts forthcoming from the New Order, the KAAC Freerunner is a financial disaster for its manufacturer, which goes bankrupt as a result.

The remaining stock is available for sale to anyone who has the credits and proper licenses (or fair forgeries). The Freerunner is popular with planetary defense forces, major cartels, and large gangs. Numerous minor arms dealers have managed to acquire dozens of the Speeders, and auctions on fringe worlds are not difficult to find. Though provided with a basic weapon load from the factory, many Freerunners are now sold without weapons (though the dealers are happy to sell a few blasters at a modest additional cost).

The Freerunner is broken into two main sections- the cockpit and the weapons platform. The cockpit is open to the air to increase the pilot's field of vision, but this also increases vulnerability. Many owners take the time to fully enclose the cockpit (an additional 1,000 credits) The independent weapon platform allows the Freerunner to carry up to four [Weapon Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems) and swap them out quickly and easily (DC 15 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check and 1 hour, if appropriate facilities are available). Though designed to be fired by [Gunners](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunners) in the weapon platform, the armaments can also be fired by the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) or [Copilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Copilot), though at a -5 penalty.

In truly hazardous regions, KAAC Freerunners are sometimes used as VIP transports and even corporate ground shuttles. They are more commonly found in use as assault craft for major city police forces and as medium tanks for mercenary fighting companies.
