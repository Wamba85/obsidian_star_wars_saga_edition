The M3-A Scyk Fighter is an extremely basic Starfighter produced under unusual circumstances. Although MandalMotors supported [The Confederacy of Independent Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems) during the Clone Wars, the Empire needed as many Starships and as much tax revenue as it could amass once it came to power. To eliminate the chance of MandalMotors working against the Empire, an Imperial advisor was placed to oversee the operations of the company.

However, this position was subject to both deception and bribery. MandalMotors did a brisk business with semi legitimate organizations, such as [The Zann Consortium](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Zann_Consortium) and Hutt business enterprises, often customizing Starships for groups that the Empire would prefer not have such vessels. One of the biggest early sellers to such groups was the Scyk, which was just dangerous enough to be worthwhile, without being so advanced as to draw Imperial attention. Production of the Starfighter ended at about the time [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) became active, though ships enjoyed a lively secondary market of sales and modifications.

The Scyk has two strong points- it's cheap, and its weapon mount is designed to handle nearly anything. Though generally produced with a single [Laser Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannon) (as represented in the statistics here), it's easy to swap out the weapon for an [Ion Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion_Cannon), [Concussion Missiles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion_Missiles), or [Proton Torpedo Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Torpedo_Launcher) (with a six-missile payload), or even a more unorthodox weapon of roughly the same size and power. Large organizations used this versatility to create small wings of Starships with complementary weapon mixes (for example, six Scyks with [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons), three with [Ion Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion_Cannons), and three with [Proton Torpedo Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Torpedo_Launchers)), while individual pilots benefit by easily replacing or upgrading damaged weapons anywhere in the galaxy.

The Scyk Fighter also mounts a [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), but lacks either a [Navicomputer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Navicomputer) or an Astromech Port for Hyperspace coordinates. The Starfighter depended on an allied ship to compute its Hyperspace jumps, and generally used the system only to go from port to port (where such aid can generally be bought), or to jump with a squad supported by a larger, [Navicomputer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Navicomputer)-equipped Starship.
