Metrocab Landspeeders, or "Robo-Hacks," are a common fact of life in crowded cities where many citizens cannot afford the luxury of a private transport. For-hire transports, these Vehicle Droids are cheap, practical, and nearly indestructible by small-arms fire (an industry standard after early Metrocabs were dismantled, vandalized, and blown apart by criminals).

The Droid Brains on these Robo-Hacks are highly sophisticated; they have complete maps of the area they are to cover, as well as a Central Learning Chip (CLC) that allows the Droid to learn from past experiences and incorporate them into future decision making. In a Vehicle Droid, this equates to learning the local shortcuts. If the planetary communication and transportation network will accommodate this, the Droid can also access data on current traffic flow patterns, potential hazards, weather conditions, and other other number of factors that can affect the safety and speed of travel. The Robo-Hack can then choose the quickest, safest course. It is rumored that some Metrocab Landspeeders are programmed to produce maximum revenue rather than provide customer services; like some of their organic counterparts, they are known to ride extra kilometers and extend the length of the journey to defraud visitors unfamiliar with the local terrain.

The interiors of Metrocabs are often spartan. They seldom have more than seats, a pair of doors, and a sealed compartment housing the Droid Brain and credit holder. The Droid Brain speaks through a small vocoder grill. The credit holder has a small extendable tray, where the customer can deposit credits or insert their [Credit Chip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Credit_Chip). Some Metrocabs also have a novel version of self-defense: in the case of attempted robbery or non-payment on the part of the customer, the doors automatically lock, preventing the customer or assailant from leaving. The individual can then be delivered to the nearest law enforcement authorities.
