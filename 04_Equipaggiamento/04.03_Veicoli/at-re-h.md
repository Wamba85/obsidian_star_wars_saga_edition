*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

Also known as the Clone Scout Walker, the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/at-re.md|AT-RE]] was designed to be deployed by an [LAAT/c Gunship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/LAAT/c_Gunship) to allow a single Clone Trooper to perform a detailed survey of a region of a planet prior to engaging in combat operations. The walker was designed specifically for recon on worlds with extreme atmospheric conditions, where the walker's weight and sealed environment allowed it to easily withstand harsh winds, toxic rains, and more. Further, the walker was common for missions on worlds with dangerous wildlife or hostile, primitive locals.

The vehicles saw limited use early in the Clone Wars under the command of Jedi General Echuu Shen-Jon, who used the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/at-re.md|AT-RE]] in an anti-armor role. Unfortunately, the walker proved inadequate against the various Tank Droids of the Separatists. A much more heavily armored version, the AT-RE/h, was created a few months into the Clone Wars, helping it match up better against Confederate Forces.

Unfortunately, the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/at-re.md|AT-RE]] never saw widespread use; its scouting role was performed much more efficiently by [Airspeeders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Airspeeders), and there were plenty of vehicles much better suited to perform as anti-armor platforms. The AT-RE/h variant did see use as a VIP transport on hostile planets, but even then kept an escort of [AT-RTs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/AT-RTs) or [Speeder Bikes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speeder_Bikes).
### Capabilities
The [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/at-re.md|AT-RE]] has an extensive cargo area for a vehicle of its size, designed to bring back samples of note from scouted planets. The passenger seat can be removed with little effort (a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action)) to make room for an additional 250 kg of cargo. Conversely, the cargo space can be converted to hold an additional two passenger seats, which is often done in the case of the VIP variant of the AT-RE/h to accommodate an additional bodyguard and a personal aide.
