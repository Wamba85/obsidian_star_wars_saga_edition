The *Gladiator*-Class Star Destroyer was originally designed by Walex Blissex for Rendili StarDrive during the Clone Wars to serve as an escort to [*Victory I*-Class Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyers). However, the *Gladiators* were not put into production until shortly after the Clone Wars. Further, the design was appropriated by the New Order and given to Kuat Drive Yards for improvement, after the *Victory* Star Destroyers were seen as something of a disappointment. Blissex received little credit for the final design.

The *Gladiator*-Class was redesigned as a long-range patrol ship, able to carry the New Order- in the form of administrators, [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters), and troops- into the far reaches of the fringe regions. Rather than being seen as small for a [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship), Imperial planners conceived of the ship as a large patrol cruiser, self-sufficient and much larger than the light [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) of pirates and planetary defense fleets it was expected to oppose. The *Gladiator*-Class was to be the first Imperial Star Destroyer many worlds saw, and it was overpowered for such simple patrol missions. As conceived, the *Gladiators* were an important part of the Tarkin Doctrine, huge by patrol-craft standards and a promise of bigger and more frightening Imperial ships to come if a local populace was uncooperative.

In actuality, although the *Gladiator* Star Destroyers were extremely effective and cost-efficient for many years, that situation changed once [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) formed a cohesive fleet of its own. Lone Imperial craft became attractive targets for a fleet that couldn't risk itself against Imperial Star Destroyers. A single *Gladiator* was easily able to deal with squadrons of smaller ships, but could be outgunned by even a small group of Mon Cal [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships). Several *Gladiator*-Class ships fell into the hands of pirate bands (Including The *Demolisher* at about 15 BBY, usually as a result of attacks on repair bays or ambushes in space. The same keel design as the *Gladiator*-Class was also used for the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/broadside-class-cruiser.md|*Broadside*-Class Cruiser]].

### Tactical Fire
Imperial Star Destroyers are designed to provide heavy gunnery support in any situation, and they excel at disrupting other [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) above all. Their weakness against other ships, such as [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters), is usually overcome by their own complement of [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters). As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Gladiator*-Class Star Destroyer can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 2-square radius. All allied Starships attacking targets within this area gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls.
