*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

One of the most recognizable Imperial spacecraft is the *Lambda*-Class Shuttle. A workhorse of the Imperial Fleet, Lambda-Class Shuttles have transported Imperial luminaries such as Lord Darth Vader, as well as Emperor Palpatine himself. It is perhaps ironic that one particular *Lambda*, the *Tydirium*, was employed by the Rebel Alliance to deliver a strike force to [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor). It was this strike team that ultimately brought the second Death Star's defensive shields down, allowing the Rebel fleet to converge and subsequently destroy the [Space Station](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Station).

The *Lambda* design was developed as the direct successor to the [*Theta*-Class Shuttle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Theta-Class_Shuttle) by a group of former Cygnus Spaceworks engineers. These engineers had been enticed into defecting to Sienar, lured by promises of high pay and tangible benefits. Even though Sienar was responsible for the ship's design and initial production run, Cygnus Spaceworks was later subcontracted to produce a heavily armed military version that was equipped with ten [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannon).

The *Lambda* was not used solely by the Empire. Even though upward of ninety percent of all *Lambdas* were in Imperial possession, the nonmilitary version, produced by Sienar, was available for sale on the open market for a short time, and numerous craft were sold to different sector governments, corporate fleets, and other private parties. Similarly, the Rebel Alliance kept a small fleet of the shuttles on hand for the transportation of sensitive personnel between different fleet elements. These shuttles were identical to the standard model, but lacked the code transponders of those utilized by the Empire.

Following the collapse of the Empire, Cygnus Spaceworks continued to produce *Lambda* shuttles. Many of these shuttles were put to use by both the New Republic and the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.

### Capabilities
The *Lambda* shuttle is best known as a multiuse transport, capable of ferrying both troops and dignitaries. When used as a troop transport, it excels at high-profile missions that require a significant amount of discretion. When the ship is used as a personal transport for Imperial dignitaries and officers, the cargo space is often converted into a comfortable living area with many of the amenities of a star yacht. Those *Lambdas* used to ferry troops are much less comfortable, and are equipped with bench seating and a limited number of bucket seats.

Though the ship was designed primarily for space flight, the tri-wing construction of the *Lambda* gives it excellent stability when flown in an atmosphere. It is a fast ship when compared to others of it's class, yet it is especially vulnerable to enemy fire when landing or taking off. Though it is equipped with a number of effective weapons systems, the Lambda is unable to outmaneuver most [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters). Because the *Lambda* is well armed, it does not technically require a fighter escort. Regardless, few of the shuttles traveled alone, depending on the sensitivity of their individual missions.

When not used as a troop transport, the *Lambda* is capable of carrying up to 80 tons of cargo. These cargoes consist primarily of mundane supplies, such as spare parts and other consumables. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a shuttle to arrive insystem by itself in order to deliver supplies. Much of the time, *Lambdas* ferry supplies directly from orbital stations and ships to planetary surfaces.

The *Lambda* is normally operated by a crew of six, including a [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)), a [Copilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Copilot), a [Navigator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Navigator), a [Gunner](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunner), a [System Operator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/System_Operator), and an [Engineer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Engineer). In a pinch, the ship can be flown by a single individual, though they would be hard-pressed to monitor all the ship's vital systems. The cockpit is typically open to the cargo/passenger area, but a blast door can be closed between the two compartments if circumstances dictate it.

*Lambda*-Class Shuttles are rarely modified from their base configuration, though some exceptions to this rule obviously exist. The specifications of the Emperor's personal shuttle, for instance, were highly classified, and can be extrapolated based only upon rumors and hearsay. It has been put forth that Palpatine's shuttle was equipped with a cloaking device, as well as an ultra-efficient hyperdrive. Since it was destroyed with the second [Death Star](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Star), none can say for certain if any of these reports are accurate.
