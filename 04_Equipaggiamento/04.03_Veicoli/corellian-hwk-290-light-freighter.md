The Corellian Engineering Corporation designed the Hawk series of transports in the decades before the Clone Wars, in an effort to break into a new market for small, fast cargo ships. Although the YT-series of ships was wildly successful financially, it was seen by the galaxy at large as being rugged but ugly- tramp ships for tramp captains. The Hawk line was aimed at more upscale clients- wealthy merchants in need of ships to land at resort worlds without being an eyesore, and nobles or politicians in need of a cargo craft for personal business that wouldn't lower their prestige. The line was a modest success, but never hit sales numbers to rival YT-series ships, and it was discontinued during the Clone Wars to make way for more military production.

The HWK-290 is the most prevalent of the Hawk-series of freighters, and a common sight through the Clone Wars and the first few decades of the New Order. It is extremely nimble for a cargo vessel, depending on maneuverability rather than strong shields or armor to survive attack. Stock versions of the ship have no [Weapon Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems), but as with most CEC models, it's easy to add a few lasers as modifications. (Linked [Blaster Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Cannons) are the most common addition, and two sets are included in the statistics here.) Ships actually intended for military use (such as The *Moldy Crow*, used by [Kyle Katarn](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kyle_Katarn) among others) can carry more than twice as many weapons, though at the expense of some cargo capacity.
