*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*
Starting with a standard [H-Type Space Yacht](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/H-Type_Space_Yacht), the Theed Palace Space Vessel Engineering Corps customized this vessel for use by the Theed Royal House. Due to its relative ease of maintenance, size and speed, the yacht was ideal for secretive getaways and undercover excursions. Since Queen Jamillia preferred to focus her attention on Naboo's domestic affairs, she had little need for such a vessel. As such, the smallest transport in Theed's hangars sat idle. Senator Padmé Amidala had been given access to this craft, as she was more likely to put it to good use.For her safety, Padmé used a refugee passenger ship to flee Coruscant along with Padawan Anakin Skywalker, seeking refuge on her homeworld of Naboo. The pair later used the ship to travel to [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine), in an attempt to rescue Anakin Skywalker's mother, before heading to [Geonosis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosis) in a failed attempt to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi. The ship was used by Padmé periodically over the course of the Clone Wars, such as when the senator carried Jedi Master Yoda to the planet of [Ilum](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ilum) to rescue Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Barriss Offee from the Chameleon Droids of the Confederacy. In the twelfth month of the war, Padmé was forced to activate the self-destruct on one of these craft when she was captured by the Confederate flagship *Malevolence*. Later, after her skiff was stolen by the charlatans Dannl Faytonni and Achk Med-Beq, Padmé used this craft to travel to [Rodia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rodia) along with Jar Jar Binks and C-3PO to convince Senator Onaconda Farr from shifting his planet's allegiance to the Confederacy. During the course of this mission, however, clumsy Jar Jar managed to drop an industrial electromagnet on the ship, crushing it beyond repair.

### Capabilities
Although the craft can be controlled by a single pilot, it can optionally be crewed by an additional copilot, navigator/commscan tech, and shield operator. The standard two Astromech [Droid Repair Team](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Repair_Team) has been kept from the original design; however, the Royal Corps of Engineers at Theed Palace have made heavy modifications to the stock [H-Type Space Yacht](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/H-Type_Space_Yacht) to accommodate its use for the Royal House. First and foremost, the royal [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo) craft has been upgraded with the [Advanced Vehicle Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Vehicle_Template). The stock hull plating has also been replaced with the distinctive chromium finish of Naboo royalty, which also reduces the total of any [Ion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion) damage received by this craft by 5. The passenger quarters have been fitted with an Extreme [Luxury Upgrade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luxury_Upgrade). The ship has been equipped with [Jamming Array](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jamming_Array) countermeasures, and a famous [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gungan.md|Gungan]] shield generator system for the best protection possible. A [Hypertransceiver](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hypertransceiver) has been installed in the bridge console, and the [Navicomputer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Navicomputer) has been upgraded to provide the most up-to-date star charts. Finally, the [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) has been tweaked to perform ten percent more efficiently than a military grade Class 1 system.

### Jamming Array
The H-Type Royal Yacht's jamming system is capable of blinding enemy sensors and fire-control computers, making it a more elusive target. When activated, the H-Type Royal Yacht's jammers cause adjacent ships to take penalties to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) score (-6 for [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters), -4 for [Space Transports](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transports), -2 for [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships)).
