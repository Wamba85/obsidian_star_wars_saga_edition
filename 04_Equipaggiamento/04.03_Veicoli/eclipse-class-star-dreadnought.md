*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

*See also: [Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Destroyers)*

The only two *Eclipse*-Class Star Dreadnoughts to be built began construction at approximately the same time as the destruction of the first Death Star, though their development was shrouded in so much secrecy that little else can be said about the process. The first of the line briefly fell into the hands of Tyber Zann, head of the criminal Zann Consortium, but the crime lord realized the Empire would never allow him to keep the ship (And would place his destruction above even that of [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) if he tried), and he abandoned it in space.

Neither ship of the class was completed prior to the death of the Emperor. As the most powerful ships left in the known galaxy, they naturally served as focal points for efforts to prevent the Empire from collapsing, but ultimately both were destroyed before they could begin reconquering the galaxy.

### Capabilities
At 17.5 kilometers in length, the *Eclipse*-Class Star Dreadnought is shorter than a standard [Super Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Star_Destroyer), but its a mistake to think of them as smaller. In fact, an *Eclipse*-Class masses much more than any other [Super Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Star_Destroyer) ever built, and uses much of the additional mass to carry a keel-mounted axial Superlaser. The *Eclipse*-Class axial Superlaser is two-thirds as powerful as one of the component projectors of a Death Star Superlaser, and thus lacks the power to destroy a planet-sized target. It can, however, smash through any conceivable shields and render a planet uninhabitable or destroy any lesser target. The weapon is difficult to aim, however, requiring the entire ship to be aligned to do so. As a result, the Superlaser takes a -20 penalty on attacks against targets smaller in size than Colossal (Cruiser).

The fighting capacity of an *Eclipse*-Class Star Dreadnought is unmatched, and neither ship was destroyed by conventional forces. Had they not fallen to sabotage and trickery, its not unreasonable to think the two massive ships might have rebuilt the Empire one system at a time, with or without supporting Starships.

### Tactical Fire
Super Star Destroyers of all kinds are exceptionally dangerous foes that can eradicate almost any enemy in mere moments. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), an *Eclipse*-Class Star Dreadnought can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 3-square radius around itself. All allied Starships within that area gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and deal +1 die of damage on a successful attack.
