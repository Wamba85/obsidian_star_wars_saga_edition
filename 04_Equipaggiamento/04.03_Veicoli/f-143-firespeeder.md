*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

Emergency Firespeeders have been an important part of making [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) life stable for centuries. In a planet-wide city, any object falling from orbit is destined to impact an inhabited area, killing thousands. Having vehicles that can catch these objects during their descent, and provide relief to disaster areas where they do fall is necessary. 

While Coruscant's take the ships and beings who operate them for granted most days, locals developed a newfound respect for them during the second Battle of [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant), where the naval battle raging overhead sent down enough debris to black out the sky in some regions to the galactic capitol. The brave crews of the Coruscant Fire Brigades were able to keep civilian casualties and property damage to a minimum due to their daring heroics. 

Captain Jikesh Valia was captain of one such ship that was assigned to the crash-landing remains of [The *Invisible Hand*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Invisible_Hand), piloted by Anakin Skywalker and carrying Chancellor Palpatine. Captain Valia's F-143 Firespeeder, along with several others like it, were able to keep the hull cool enough for Skywalker to land it safely, saving the Chancellor. 

### Capabilities
The F-143 Firespeeder is the most capable of emergency services and disaster relief ship type stationed on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant). Equipped with a [Tractor Beam](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tractor_Beam) to catch falling debris, four high-pressure cannons with which to attack fires, and highly trained medical and emergency response crews onboard, the ship can handle anything from a burning building to a falling asteroid.

The ship has six high-pressure tanks filled with a variety of agents to combat fires, including water, foam, and specialized chemicals; each tank has enough liquid for 500 "bursts." The ship also loads twenty repulsor discs in a small forward landing bay to allow firefighters to enter burning or collapsing buildings quickly, along with two-hundred fifty anti-gravity life jackets, six spare hazard suits, and a vast array of cutting equipment.

The F-143 Firespeeder also has a medical bay with twenty medical beds, typically including a surgeon, a general practitioner, and five Medical Droids. Of course, most firefighters are trained in emergency medical life-saving techniques as well.
