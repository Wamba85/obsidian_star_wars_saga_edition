*Homebrew Reference Book: [The Old Republic Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Sourcebook) (Converted by Wikia users Crinoshunter and Elitesqadron)*

Developed at the height of [The Great Galactic War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Galactic_War), the *Defender* was custom-built for [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order). The Jedi Council commissioned the starship after determining that Republic military vessels were not well-suited to The Jedi’s more specialized missions.

The *Defender’s* exterior design is based on the consumer model corvette, but it has been outfitted with countless customized upgrades. The Starship includes two levels. The formal upper level features diplomatic meeting rooms and an elegant conference room at the ship’s center. The conference room contains a unique [Hypertransceiver](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hypertransceiver) system for secure communications with the Jedi Council. The *Defender’s* lower level includes a cargo hold, a [Medical Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_Suite), and a small private space in which the Jedi can retreat for meditation.

Despite The Jedi Order’s commitment to peace, the ship is battle-ready. If circumstances warrant, the *Defender* is engineered with high-powered shields and Twin [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons) to engage the enemy.

:*"Welcome aboard this Corellian *Defender*-Class Light Corvette. It was custom-built to offer a Jedi both first-rate combat performance and meditation amenities."*

*-C2-N2*

The *Defender*-Class is the product of the Rendili Vehicle Corporation. Manufactured on [Corellia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corellia), the *Defender*-Class Light Corvette was modeled after a similar consumer corvette that was inspired by the Republic Military's [*Thranta*-Class Corvette](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thranta-Class_Corvette), but the *Defender*-Class was modified specifically for use by [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) as a mobile operations base and a capable [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) in its own right. The corvette could be flown by a single [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)), and it was equipped with heavy shielding, two sets of Dual [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons), and missiles. The *Defender*-Class has seen use by [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) throughout the Cold War and [The Great Galactic War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Galactic_War) with the Empire, and several of the Order's greatest heroes have flown *Defender*-Class Corvettes on their adventures across the galaxy. Rendili specifically designed the vessel's color scheme of red and white to create a vessel that would inspire fear in the Republic's enemies and instantly announce the presence of a Jedi on battlefields across the galaxy.

Measuring seventy-nine meters wide and ninety-four meters long, the *Defender*-Class is twenty-nine meters tall when resting on its four landing gear. The frontal hull of the corvette is curved at an angle that deflects enemy laser fire easily, and two sets of twin laser cannons are situated at either end of the bow, while the corvette's bridge is located in the center between the ship's main running lights. The main body of the ship is roughly in the shape of a triangular figure-eight, with the rear of the ship sporting two access hatches on either side and the corvette's twin thrusters situated at the end of the vessel.

The access hatches are situated on either side of the main conference room, with the sensor array and communications dish located on the exterior of the vessel above the conference room. The primary boarding ramp is located in the center of the corvette's lower hull and opens out beneath the ship's bridge. The *Defender*-Class Corvette is equipped with high-powered deflector shields for defense, while the ship's missile launchers allow it to take on enemy vessels of far greater size and strength.

The *Defender*-Class Light Corvette was intended to serve as a base of operations for Jedi on assignment throughout the galaxy, and as such the vessel can fill a variety of roles. The Starship's amenities and conference rooms allow a Jedi to carry out important diplomatic negotiations between parties on neutral ground, and the *Defender*-Class's powerful weapons and defense systems allow it to serve as a [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter), in which skilled pilots can take on far larger [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships).
