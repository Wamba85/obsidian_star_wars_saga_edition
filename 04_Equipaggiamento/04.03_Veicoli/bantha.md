Perhaps the most adaptable herbivores in the galaxy, Banthas are found on numerous worlds and are so well known that their name is used in a plethora of proverbs, sayings, and children's stories. Several fringe religions see the Bantha as a divine messenger. Banthas can survive in most environmental extremes, and are able to go without food or water for several weeks. Although many subspecies have adapted to the peculiarities of their environments, most Banthas have large, curving horns and long, shaggy fur.

Banthas are commonly used as transportation and as beasts of burden. Their meat and hides are highly prized, particularly by the [Tusken Raiders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tusken_Raiders) of [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine), who use the beasts extensively.

### Banthas Across the Galaxy
The Bantha serves as an archetypical mount and pack animal anywhere in the galaxy. The Bantha statistics below represent the baseline for the common Bantha. Gamemasters should feel free to alter that statistics block to make the Bantha better fit the environment in which it is found.

As examples, the dune Banthas of [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine) would have the Desert [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) trait, and the white-furred Banthas of [Nelvaan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nelvaan) would have the Arctic [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) trait. The [Kashyyyk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyyyk) grayclimber subspecies would exchange the [Trample](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trample_(Beast_Trait)) attack for the Expert Climber quality. Aquatic or Subterranean Banthas might be waiting out there in the galaxy for your intrepid group of explorers to discover.

### Abilities
**Trample:**Â As a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), a Bantha can move up to its speed and through enemies' spaces. This movement provokes [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity) as normal, and the Bantha must end its movement in an unoccupied space. When it enters an enemy's space, the Bantha makes a Trample attack; on a hit, the target is knocked [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone).
