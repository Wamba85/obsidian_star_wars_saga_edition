The YT-2400 is the CEC's bid to produce a "Perfect" light freighter. An upgrade of the [YT-2000](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/YT-2000) design, it incorporates everything learned during the run of the long and successful YT line. Though it uses many of the same technology upgrades as the short-run [YT-2000](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/YT-2000), the YT-2400 returned to the off-center cockpit arrangement. Though for both smaller and larger craft a center-mounted cockpit makes sense, it turned out that many pilots preferred an offset cockpit so they could easily dock their ships with the cockpit side directly against a wall or similar obstruction.

Though the YT-2400 isn't as sturdy as the [YT-2000](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/YT-2000), it has thirty percent more cargo capacity, an [Escape Pod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_Pod) built into the cockpit section (+5 bonus to [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) checks made to enter the [Escape Pod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_Pod) from the cockpit if the YT-2400 is destroyed), and better maneuverability. Since most owners end up adding additional weapons and defenses after purchase anyway, the slightly reduced martial capacity of the YT-2400 does little to discourage sales.

Among the most well-known YT-2400s is The *Outrider*, the ship of smuggler and mercenary Dash Rendar.

### Capabilities
All YT-series ships are solid light freighters, renowned for being sturdy and reliable. Their greatest asset is their easily modified nature. With less effort than for nearly any other ship line, a YT-Series vessel can be fine-tuned to act as a smuggler, bulk hauler, luxury transport, or even a gunship or patrol craft. Every YT-Series ship has 10 unused [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points) as a stock ship, and new captains are quick to use them to add more guns, better shields, or whatever else their minds can conjure up. This adaptability is intentional, and has often led to authorities claiming that CEC designs the ships for use by smugglers and pirates. The CEC points out that thousands of YT ships are being used by law-abiding free traders and small companies. Of course, how many of those "Law-Abiding" customers are actually smugglers or spies is unknown and, more important, not provable in court.
