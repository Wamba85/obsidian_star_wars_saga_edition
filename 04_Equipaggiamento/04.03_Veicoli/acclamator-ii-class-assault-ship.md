*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

The *Acclamator II* was put into circulation near the end of the Clone Wars. Though similar in design and function to the original [*Acclamator*-Class Assault Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acclamator-Class_Assault_Ship), the second iteration was designed specifically with [Orbital Bombardment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Orbital_Bombardment) in mind. Equipped with several Batteries of powerful [Turbolasers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Turbolasers), as well as a pair of [Heavy Proton Torpedo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Proton_Torpedo) tubes, the *Acclamator II* was a fearsome sight for anyone unlucky enough to be on the receiving end of its deadly payload.

Though several other variants of the *Acclamator* appeared during the course of the Clone Wars, only the *Acclamator II* was utilized by the Republic in significant numbers.

### Capabilities
When used for planetary bombardment, the *Acclamator II* exceeded all expectations. Armed with two [Heavy Proton Torpedo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Proton_Torpedo) tubes, in addition to a full complement of [Turbolasers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Turbolasers), a single assault ship could snuff out life on an entire continent in the course of a few hours. Additionally, the ship's [Turbolasers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Turbolasers) could easily be used in ship-to-ship combat, increasing the vessel's survivability during protracted space battles.

The [Heavy Proton Torpedoes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Proton_Torpedoes) utilized by the *Acclamator II* were forerunners of those that would eventually see use on Imperial torpedo spheres. Though capable of locking on to capital-scale targets in space, the torpedoes were specifically tailored to breach Planetary Shields and spread deadly proton energy across population centers. When used against other targets of any size, the torpedoes take a -10 penalty on attack roll (already included in its statistics), in addition to any other penalties.

In order to make room for so many powerful [Weapon Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems), the designers of the *Acclamator II* were forced to reduce the ship's troop complement by nearly eighty percent. Because of these reductions, this iteration of the *Acclamator* was rarely, if ever, used to land significant numbers of troops.

### Tactical Fire
Specializing in [Orbital Bombardments](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Orbital_Bombardment), *Acclamator II*-Class Assault Ships can unleash a heavy assault on a single target. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), an *Acclamator II*-Class Assault Ship can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 2-square radius around itself. Any ship that is reduced to 0 Hit Points within that area is automatically destroyed, even if the attack that reduced it to 0 Hit Points did not deal enough damage to exceed its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold).
