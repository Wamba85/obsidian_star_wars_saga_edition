The Empire doesn't always want to obliterate opposing starships, sometimes there's someone or something of importance within an enemy's vessel. The Imperial Drill Pod can be used in such situations, escorting up to 10 troopers to a starship, cutting a hole in the hull, and dropping them inside to secure their target. The Imperial Drill Pod is clearly inspired by the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/droch-class-boarding-ship.md|Droch-Class Boarding Ship]] previously used by the Separatists, and so it has many similarities to that craft. The most noticeable difference between the two designs, is the lack of Laser Cannons on the Imperial Drill pod; Making this variation unable to fire back against opposing starfighters. Due to this lack of weaponry, it has slightly better protection than the Droch-Class ship.

The Imperial Drill Pod Boarding Craft has a special Boarding Drill on its forward section that can be used to drill into a Starship and release its passengers safely inside the ship. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) of the Imperial Drill Pod Boarding Craft can make an attack with the Boarding Drill against a ship in an adjacent square. If the attack succeeds, the Boarding Craft moves into the target's space and attaches itself to the hull of the target ship without triggering a [Collision](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Collision). Each round thereafter, as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) can use the Boarding Drill to make a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check and deal damage to the target ship equal to the [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check's result, ignoring the target ship's [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating). When the target ship has taken cumulative damage from the Boarding Drill in excess of its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), the Boarding Craft punches through and its passengers can enter the target ship safely.
