*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

Placed into production during the reign of Chancellor Kalpana, the *Eddicus*-Class Shuttles were an atmospheric counterpart to the CEC [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/consular-class-cruiser.md|*Consular*-Class Cruiser]]. Then-Senator Palpatine of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo) was on the committee that took bids on the shuttles, and manipulated his fellow delegates to give the contract to Kuat Systems Engineering, where Sidious had leverage over a number of engineers. The shuttles were produced en masse and used by the upper echelon of [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) politicians for secure transport around the capitol when engaging in official business.

The shuttles continued to see use throughout the Clone Wars and beyond. Even Jedi were known to be transported by the shuttles when summoned to testify at Senate hearings or other high-profile appearances with government officials. Shuttles specifically attached to the Chancellor's office were draped in Republic Blue, while those designated for the Senate's use were painted Diplomatic Red.

### Capabilities
This 32-meter shuttle represents one of the most advanced pieces of transportation on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant). It is equipped with a [Jamming Array](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jamming_Array), the heaviest armor plating and shielding available for its class, and is deceptively fast and equipped with [Combat Thrusters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Thrusters)- though its actual top speed is classified. The ship is also outfitted with a number of three-being [Escape Pods](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_Pods) to allow for the evacuation of all personnel, and a [Hypertransceiver](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hypertransceiver) ([HoloNet Transceiver](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/HoloNet_Transceiver) for the Chancellor). These ships are incredibly tough, and are crewed only by the very best the Republic has to offer (Use Ace [Crew Quality](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Crew_Quality) for the Chancellor).

Concealed within the ships (DC 20 [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check to spot, but only eligible to make the check if in the passenger cabin and making a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to make repairs or modifications to the ship) are a number of listening devices installed at the behest of Darth Sidious, which provided much of the information he used to manipulate the entirety of the Clone Wars.

### Jamming Array
The *Eddicus*-Class Planetary Shuttle's jamming system is capable of blinding enemy sensors and fire-control computers, making it an even more elusive target.
