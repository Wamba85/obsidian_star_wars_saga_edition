This is a cheap [Orbital Bombardment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Orbital_Bombardment) satellite, made of re-purposed [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/escape-pod.md|Escape Pod]] - it has all passenger spaces and survival gear removed, engines swapped with even weaker ones, has remote-control system installed, and is crammed to the brims with [Weapon Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems). Sometimes it also has droid brain installed - but usually, it's commanded by operator from the ground.

While unsightly and crude, it gets it's job done. It's commonly used for [Orbital Bombardment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Orbital_Bombardment), as it can shoot at targets on nearly any point of the planet. In times of need, it can be used to guard space installations, or to fight off enemy ships. While it can be equipped with powerful weapons, it is very fragile, and therefore should attack enemies from afar.

Generally, this is a middle-line satellite, bigger than most cheap and civilian satellites (what typically range from Large to Tiny and even Diminutive sizes), but smaller than most orbital fortifications and space stations.

Due to having no life supports and very fuel-efficient engines, this satellite can work indefinitely.

Because the already weak engines of [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/escape-pod.md|Escape Pod]] were replaced with even weaker ones, Huge Orbital Bombardment Satellite can either move (relative to other ships) **or** shoot - but not at the same time.

The cost of base satellite is stated to be negative, but cost of fully-armed satellite is usually positive. For example, Huge Orbital Bombardment Satellite with [Heavy Blaster Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Cannon_(Vehicles)) will cost 4100 credits.

Due to being little more than a bunch of guns with a energy generator and rudimentary engines, and also due to being a mostly-stationary emplacement, Huge Orbital Bombardment Satellite can be equipped with systems what normally have size restrictions. For example, you can install [Turbolaser](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Turbolaser) on it.
