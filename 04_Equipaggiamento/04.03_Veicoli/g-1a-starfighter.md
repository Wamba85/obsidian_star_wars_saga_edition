*G-1A Starfighter data created by Wikia user Dark-Lark.*

The G-1A Starfighter is a large, sturdily built craft with a flexible battlefield role that endears it to some Outer Rim freelancers. Originally designed as an all-purpose system patrol craft by Byblos Drive Yards, the G-1A is a well-designed ship constructed for speed rather than agility.

Designed originally as a system patrol and interdiction craft, the G-1A shares several features with other popular ships of its size. It is moderately armored but has a sturdy hull with a reinforced keel and one of the highest-performance shield generators of any ship in its class. The G-1A carries a respectable weapons loadout consisting of energy weapons and heavy ordnance launchers. Its sensors and comms package is respectable, if not particularly outstanding, and its targeting and flight control systems are intuitive and well designed. All these features leave little room for the crew and passengers; quarters are very cramped aboard a G-1A.

While it doesn't stand out in any one way performance-wise, the G-1A does shine in its modification potential. Byblos left ample room in the design for upgrades and additions to the fighter's stock systems. While Byblos envisioned producing several aftermarket weapons and sensor packages, the G-1A never gained the popularity or sales numbers it expected, and the company drastically scaled back production. Few of the aftermarket packages were ever built. Still, of the G-1As that were sold, very few are in their original configuration; almost all have seen some form of modification by their owners.

### Using a G-1A Starfighter
The G-1A's ability to transport a group of five beings makes for a unique alternative as a PC group transport, if a cramped one. Its weapons loadout and shield system make it a solid combat vessel, but its poor handling makes it ill-suited for dogfights in any but the most skilled pilots' hands.

While the G-1A's hull strength is high for its size, it is below average compared to the light freighters many groups use as transportation. The fighter compensates for this with its powerful shield system.

#### **Adventure and Encounter Seeds**

- Alliance Command has a plan to steal crucial strategic data from an Imperial sector station. While Rebel forces tie up the station's defenders, the heroes are given a G-1A, whose boxy profile is a perfect fit to enter through the TIE launch corridor. The heroes are tasked with blasting through the computer-room wall and physically stealing the station's datacore.
- While hauling vital (and valuable) cargo, the heroes are attacked by a trio of G-1A Starfighters. The patrol boats fly close enough to allow boarders with grappling guns to leap onto the heroes' ship and begin cutting into its outer doors. The attackers could be from a criminal organization, rivals to the heroes, or a mysterious third party.
