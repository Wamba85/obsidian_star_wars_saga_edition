A new suit of power armor that was in development during the Clone Wars, the Space Trooper Armor prototypes were field tested by the [Galactic Marines](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Marines), formerly the 21st Nova Corps, at the Battle of [New Bornalex](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Bornalex), five months before the end of the epic conflict. The prototypes' weapon systems failed, and Bacara and his men were forced to fight on, relying on their hand-to-hand combat training, augmented by the powerful exo-skeleton, to defeat wave after wave of [B2-Series Super Battle Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/B2-Series_Super_Battle_Droids).

Over two meters tall, Space Trooper Armor sought to give the marines the same offensive capabilities as an assault fighter, while retaining the ability to access and take over enemy ships. The Space Trooper Armor prototype began life as an [Armored Spacesuit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armored_Spacesuit), and was considered to be Large in size, and has had its max [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus and joint protection stripped once each. Its flight systems allow a fly speed of 4 squares, and a [Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale) speed of 1 square.

The armor included a wrist mounted [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-cannon.md|Blaster Cannon]], a wrist mounted [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/miniature-proton-torpedo-launcher.md|Miniature Proton Torpedo Launcher]], a pair of shoulder mounted [Grenade Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade_Launchers), [Vacuum Seals](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vacuum_Seals), [Powered Exoskeleton](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Powered_Exoskeleton), and a [Helmet Package](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Package). [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) included a [Bracer Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bracer_Computer), [Halo Lamp](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Halo_Lamp), [Jet Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jet_Pack), [Hands-Free Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hands-Free_Comlink) (Long-Range), [Polarized Lenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Polarized_Lenses), and a [Power Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Generator). The Space Trooper Armor in use during the Clone Wars is considered to have the [Prototype General Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prototype_General_Template), including the [Improved Durability](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Improved_Durability) and [Enhanced Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Enhanced_Strength) traits.
