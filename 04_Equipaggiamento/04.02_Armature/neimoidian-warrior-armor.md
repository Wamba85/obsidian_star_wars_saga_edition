*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

Worn by the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/neimoidian.md|Neimoidian]] warriors in the service of the Trade Federation, this armor is just as much ceremonial as it is functional. It consists of a stylish jumpsuit with textured armor plating attached to cover the chest, forearms, shins, and shoulders accompanied by a helmet and a flexible, short kama and codpiece. The lack of total coverage allows [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/neimoidian.md|Neimoidian]] warriors better flexibility in melee combat and a greater degree of freedom of movement for marksmanship.
