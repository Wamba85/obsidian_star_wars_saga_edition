The Tracker Utility Vest is a simple garment that allows hunters and guides to carry a wide assortment of small [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) without discomforting the wearer. Although they can be constructed from an assortment of materials, Tracker Utility Vests are commonly made from a tough, leathery hide treated to be watertight, stainproof, and resistant to rips and tears.

The vest features pockets, pouches, and straps capable of carrying up to twenty-four small objects weighing no more than 1 kilogram each.

Because the items are stored so that their weight is distributed evenly around the wearer's torso, their cumulative weight is halved for purposes of calculating the wearer's total carried weight.
