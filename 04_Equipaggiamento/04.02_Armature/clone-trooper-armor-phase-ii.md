The Phase II Clone Trooper Armor was created by the armorsmiths of [Kamino](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kamino) after considerable input from both Jedi and clones in the field. The armor began see implementation near the midpoint of the Clone Wars. The Phase II addressed the heaviness of its predecessor, weighing only half that of the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Phase I]] series. It was also designed to be more flexible, providing better range of motion. Additionally, the level of protection provided by the Phase II armor and its internal systems saw improvement over the older version.

Phase II Clone Trooper armor protects its wearer from atmospheric conditions and vacuums as if it were an [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/armored-flight-suit.md|Armored Flight Suit]]. With its integrated [Helmet Package](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Package), this armor grants a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to all [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks as well as Low-Light Vision to any wearer with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/armor-proficiency-light.md|Armor Proficiency (Light)]] Feat.

A [Rangefinder](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rangefinder) has been installed into the armor's visor to assist in the use of weaponry. The armor is also more modular than the older model- fitted with a 10-slot [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) package as well as 2 free [Upgrade Slots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrade_Slots). The stock Phase II armor's [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) is fitted with [Droptacs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droptacs), [Bracer Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bracer_Computer), [Breath Mask](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Breath_Mask), [Decibel Shielding](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Decibel_Shielding), [Halo Lamp](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Halo_Lamp), [Hands-Free Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hands-Free_Comlink), [Sound Dampeners](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sound_Dampeners) and [Polarized Lenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Polarized_Lenses), leaving two equipment slots free.
