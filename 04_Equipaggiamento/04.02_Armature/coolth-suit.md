**Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment

These bulky protective suits were typically used by [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) from cold environments to endure planets with much warmer climates than they are accustomed. Using a coolth system, the suit continually lowered the temperature inside to keep the wearer comfortable despite the comparatively scorching conditions outside. Frequently, the suits are coated with a reflective finish to assist in preventing heat from entering the suit.

Any character wearing this suit becomes immune to the effects of [Extreme Heat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Heat). While the standard model Coolth Suit has an adjustable internal climate, cheaper models (2,000 credits) have preset temperatures to avoid mechanical malfunction. The economy models have an adverse effect on [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) not accustomed to the preset temperature and suffer exposure to [Extreme Cold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold) unless they wear some form of insulated clothing underneath the Coolth Suit.
