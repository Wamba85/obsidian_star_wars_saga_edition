*Special Operations Armor System Equipment data created by Wikia user JediPorg12.*

An advanced variant of [Clone Trooper Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtrooper_Armor), it is manufactured by Aratech and is one of their few notable products that are not vehicles. Worn by the [Special Operation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Special_Operations_Clone_Trooper) divisions, SOAS are advanced versions of typical military armors with integrated [Environmental Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Environmental_Systems) for heat and cold, 5 slots of [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment), and a [Helmet Package](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Package) installed with a coating of [Reflec Shadowskin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflec_Shadowskin).

To offset the hefty weight of the added upgrades, the entirety of the SOAS is constructed out of [Armorplast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armorplast), resulting in a lack of mass production.
