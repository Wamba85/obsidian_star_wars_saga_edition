Used by assassins and burglars, the Shadowsuit manufactured by Ayelixe/Krongbing Textiles is little more than a black body stocking covering the wearer's entire body. Shadowsuits are made from a tough but soft material known as Shadowsilk that absorbs light and sound. The hands and feet of the Shadowsuit have sound-dampening pads that reduce the noise made by the wearer.
