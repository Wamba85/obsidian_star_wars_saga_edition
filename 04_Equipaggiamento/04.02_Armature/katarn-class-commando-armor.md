*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

Issued several months after the Battle of [Geonosis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosis), *Katarn*-Class Commando Armor is a superior, specialized armor, designed with input from [Clone Commandos](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Commandos) in the field. This highly sought after armor is rarely found in the possession of civilians; its [Black Market](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Market) price can exceed a quarter-million credits.

The armor is unusually thick, with a sealed system allowing the wearer to survive underwater or in [Vacuum](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vacuum) for up to 24 hours. It also features a built-in, retractable, wrist-mounted [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/vibroblade.md|Vibroblade]].

Commando Armor grants a wearer with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/armor-proficiency-heavy.md|Armor Proficiency (Heavy)]] feat a +2 bonus on [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks, as well as Low-Light Vision. The armor includes an integrated [Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Comlink) in the helmet, allowing hands-free communication.

As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), the wearer can use the Bacta tanks built into the Armor. The Bacta and the suit's built-in diagnostic gear grant the wearer an effective [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) +10 bonus for self-treatment. The wearer ignores the -5 penalty for self-administration of this Skill.

*Katarn*-Class Commando Armor is highly customizable. If you are using the [Armor Upgrades](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Upgrades) options from *[Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scum_and_Villainy)*, the Commando Armor has the [Vacuum Seals](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vacuum_Seals) upgrade as well as three additional [Upgrade Slots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrade_Slots).
