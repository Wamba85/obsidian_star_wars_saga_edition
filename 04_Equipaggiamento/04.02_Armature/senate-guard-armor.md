Also referred to as Blue Guard Armor, this suit was worn by the security force charged with the protection of senators of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) and various government complexes on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant). This armor provides limited protection to the wearer, but is largely ceremonial in nature. It is worn underneath an elaborate costume consisting of a flowing, royal blue cape. In the midst of the Clone Wars, this armor was rapidly phased out in favor of a more functional variation derived from [Clone Trooper Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Trooper_Armor).
