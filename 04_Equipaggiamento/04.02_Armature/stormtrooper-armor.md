Worn by the elite soldiers of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire), Stormtrooper Armor comes in a variety of models based around a standard white-and black shell.

Variants of this armor also exist, including Snowtrooper Armor, Sandtrooper Armor, and Clone Trooper Armor.

Designed by the onboard computers of [The Star Forge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Star_Forge) and replicated millions of times over, Sith Trooper Armor is silver multi-piece plating worn over a sealed black body glove, with a helmet incorporating a blast shield, [Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Comlink), and [Helmet Package](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Package).

## Homebrew Clone Trooper Armor Variations

*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

Despite the fact that [Clone Trooper Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Trooper_Armor) was made to be fully modular, the armor was typically pre-fitted to specifications dictated by individual military units. These are known configurations of clone trooper armor used during the Clone Wars.

**[Clone Assassin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Assassin):** This armor uses the standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] or [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-ii.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase II]] with a [Weapon Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Mount) and a [Shadowskin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowskin) into its available upgrade slots. Installed on the weapon mounts are two [Vibroblades](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibroblades). The components of [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) installed on the armor are a portable computer, droptacs, a kama, neck guard, and sound-dampeners. The Phase II variation also includes a long-range, hands-free, encrypted comlink, [Lock Breaking Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lock_Breaking_Kit), and [Security Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Security_Kit).

**[Clone Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Pilot):** Clone Trooper Pilots do not differ much from standard [Clone Troopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Troopers) in terms of equipment load-out. In the first half of the war, pilots generally wore standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] with a [Computer Interface Visor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Computer_Interface_Visor) added to its stock equipment ([Portable Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Portable_Computer), halo-lamp, droptacs, and sound-dampeners). In the latter half of the war, pilots switched to the light [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-light.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Light]] with the same configuration, as a greater degree of movement was favored over protection.

**[Clone Scout Trooper](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Scout_Trooper):** A specialized unit introduced in the latter half of the Clone Wars, scout troopers utilized light clone trooper armor with built-in electrobinoculars in addition to the standard configuration of a long-range [Hands-Free Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hands-Free_Comlink), droptacs, and sound-dampeners. Scout trooper armor is sometimes covered in a camouflage pattern (takes up an equipment slot) that has the same effect as non-powered [Camouflage Netting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Camouflage_Netting).

**[Clone Subtrooper](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Subtrooper):** Designed to operate under several atmospheres of pressure typical to many ocean worlds, Aquatic Clone Troopers use standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] or the newer, [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-light.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Light]]. The armor has been fitted with the [Aquatic Adaptation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aquatic_Adaptation) upgrade, and comes equipped with droptacs, sound-dampeners, halo lamp, portable computer, and long-range, [Hands-Free Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hands-Free_Comlink) installed into its [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment).

**Cold Assault Clone Trooper:** One of the first specialized units, the Cold Assault Clone Trooper uses standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] or [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-ii.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase II]] with a cold-weather [Environmental Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Environmental_Systems). The [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) compounds consist of droptacs, a portable computer, kama, neck guard, and sound dampeners.

**Combat Engineer Trooper:** Clone Trooper Combat Engineers wear this armor in the battlefield. It is a standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] or [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-ii.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase II]] with a [Computer Interface Visor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Computer_Interface_Visor) and [Mechanical Interface Visor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanical_Interface_Visor) installed into its [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) to provide them with on-the-spot schematics to perform the necessary repairs to keep the Republic’s artillery and mobile infantry in fighting condition.

**Covert-Ops Trooper:** Used to carry out covert operations most efficiently, this armor is the standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] or [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-ii.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase II]] with a reflec [Shadowskin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowskin) installed in one of its available [Upgrade Slots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrade_Slots). Typically, a [Stealth Field Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth_Field_Generator) is installed as one of its [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) systems along with a portable computer, long-range, handsfree encrypted comlink, droptacs, and sound-dampeners.

**High-Orbit Precision Entry Trooper:** These highly-specialized Clone Troopers used *Katarn*-Class Battle Armor fitted with a repulsorlift unit installed into one of its available upgrade slots. Its [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment) includes a long-range, hands-free encrypted comlink, droptacs, sound dampeners, halo lamp, and a hush-about personal [Jet Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jet_Pack).

**[Senate Commando](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Senate_Commando):** While not generally Clone Troopers, [The Senate Guard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Senate_Guard) adopted the Clone Trooper Armor in the early stages of the war. Senate Commando armor is standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] or [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-ii.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase II]] equipped with [Hands-Free Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hands-Free_Comlink), droptacs, and sound dampeners.

**Sky Troopers:** Sky Troopers use standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-i.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase I]] or [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/clone-trooper-armor-phase-ii.md|Clone Trooper Armor, Phase II]] with a [Jet Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jet_Pack) in their [Integrated Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Integrated_Equipment). It also incorporates a long-range, hands-free, encrypted comlink, droptacs, sound dampeners, and a portable computer.
