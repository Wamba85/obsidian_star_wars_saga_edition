[Wookiees](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiees) craft their own suit of armor from materials native to their world. Their design varies from piece to piece, as do their protective properties. Typically, however, the armor is designed primarily to protect vital organs and to leave other areas exposed in order to prevent hampered movement and create less noise while on the hunt.
