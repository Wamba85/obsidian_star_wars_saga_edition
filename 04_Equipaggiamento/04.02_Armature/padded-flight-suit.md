Favored by [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) pilots all over the galaxy, the one-piece added Flight Suit protects against decompression, g-force, and harmful environments. It provides limited protection against attacks as well.

A Padded Flight Suit comes with a matching helmet and gloves that seal around the wearer and provide up to 10 hours of life support, allowing them to survive in the vacuum of space or any other hostile environment.
