The Beskar'gam is the traditional suit of Mandalorian Armor. Unlike the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/mandalorian-battle-armor.md|Mandalorian Battle Armor]], most suits of Beskar'gam are individually tailored to the wearer. They usually have various customizations, ranging from simple coloration changes to significant structural alterations. The Beskar'gam is extremely rare outside of Mandalorian culture and costs 30,000 more than a traditional suit of Mandalorian Armor.

True Beskar'gam is made of Mandalorian Iron (Beskar) which is strong enough to deflect blaster fire and even [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers), and when worn by a true Mandalorian warrior it can greatly reduce the amount of damage taken even from direct hits.

Not all suits of Mandalorian Armor are Beskar'gam (for example, the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/mandalorian-battle-armor.md|Mandalorian Battle Armor]] worn during [The Mandalorian Wars](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorian_Wars) was not made of Beskar), but a wearer of the Beskar'gam is a fearsome sight indeed.

A suit of Beskar'gam grants favorable circumstances on [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate), and if the wearer has DR than the wearer can apply its benefit against attacks made by [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers). Though not Powered Armor, Beskar'gam Armor has two free [Upgrade Slots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrade_Slots).

Gamemasters can reduce the cost of Beskar'gam by 30,000 credits for Mandalorian heroes.
