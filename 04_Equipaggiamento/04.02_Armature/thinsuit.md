Insulating against extreme pressure and temperature, a Thinsuit is a skintight garment that covers the entire body except for the face, which is covered by a [Breath Mask](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Breath_Mask) that provides 1 hour of breathable air.

The Thinsuit comes with an [Environmental System](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Environmental_Systems) of miniscule heaters and coolers that allow the wearer to remain comfortable in [Extreme Heat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Heat) and [Extreme Cold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold). It provides the wearer with a +5 bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) when resisting [Extreme Temperatures](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Temperatures).

In addition, the suit further reduces damage taken in such circumstances. If an attack is successful, the character takes only half damage and does not move along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), while a failed attack deals no damage.
