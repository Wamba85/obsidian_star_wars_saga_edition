For over 100 years, [The Galactic Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Alliance) has used variations of its own [Light Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Armor) design, usually in dark blue hues with black accents. In its most recent form, the Armor combines a padded armor base with a reinforced breastplate and fully armored gauntlets.

Some front-line troopers also use a fully enclosed helmet with a [Helmet Package](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Helmet_Package), but this varies by unit. It is not uncommon to see officers and others opt to use Galactic Alliance uniform hats and caps instead.

Some variations of the standard Galactic Alliance uniform incorporate a flexible blast vest and a tight-fitting, open-faced helmet into their designs. This type is especially prevalent among the fleet crews at battle stations. It provides the same bonuses as a regular [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.02_Armature/blast-helmet-and-vest.md|Blast Helmet and Vest]].
