*Gamorrean Warmace Weapon data created by Wikia user AiserLaran.*

Favoured by many [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gamorrean.md|Gamorrean]] warriors, the Gamorrean Warmace is essentially an oversized mace having a heavy striking metal head with a top spike mounted atop a long handle traditionally made of robust Gorgt wood. The weapon is known as *Thogk* in the Gamorrean language, meaning "log with a spike in". The Gamorrean Warmace can be used both to crush opponents with powerful swings and to impale them with the long spike on top.

The Gamorrean Warmace is heavy and bulky enough to require a minimum [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 14 to be effectively used in combat. Otherwise the wielder suffers a -5 penalty to all attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and cannot utilize any Feats, Talents or special abilities associated with this weapon.
