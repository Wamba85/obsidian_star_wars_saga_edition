Primarily found in the hands of [Tusken Raiders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tusken_Raiders), the Gaderffii (also called a Gaffi Stick) is a pole weapon made from scrap metal. It always features a spike or blade on one end and some kind of bludgeoning instrument on the other.

Similar weapons are sometimes carried by the raiders and scavengers of many worlds, especially in places that include old battlegrounds or plenty of discarded junk.

A Gaderffii is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty; certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties.
