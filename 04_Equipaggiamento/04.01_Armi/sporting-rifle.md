*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Sporting slugthrower rifles are legal on most worlds and generally used for hunting and personal defense. Sporting rifles are typically long-barreled weapons with fixed stocks and basic sights, though advanced optics are easily mounted. Sporting rifles use low-capacity magazines, as an accurate first shot is often more important than rapid firing. Sporting rifles are among some of the most durable and reliable types of slugthrower weapons available, requiring almost no regular maintenance to operate efficiently.

A sporting rifle requires a magazine to operate. After 6 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
