*Lightsaber Pistol Equipment data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

While [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Jedi) generally has no use for blasters, Force-users during the reign of the Empire often needed to conceal their relationship with [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), and could not rely on using their [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers) openly. Through customization, a second emitter could be added to the hilt that would release the weapon's energy as a projectile similar to a blaster bolt. Because the energy released was not encased within the focusing field that shaped the blade of a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), the bolts fired from the pistol hilt weakened rapidly as its coherence declined. These short-range stun bolts still caused some shock, but were not as effective as a blaster or [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) blade.

A Lightsaber Pistol can operate in two distinct modes: Lightsaber mode and Blaster mode, changing between these modes requires a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). A Lightsaber Pistol can fire bolts of energy while in Blaster mode. When used in this way, the Lightsaber Pistol is treated as a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) for the purposes of determining [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).

A Lightsaber Pistol requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate while in Blaster mode. After 100 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced. A Lightsaber Pistol additionally requires a special [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate while in Lightsaber mode (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).
