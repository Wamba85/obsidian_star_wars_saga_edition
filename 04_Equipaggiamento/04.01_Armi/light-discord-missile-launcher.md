*Light Discord Missile Launcher weapon data created by unknown Wikia user.*

The Light Discord Missile Launcher is an antivehicle weapon used by military units on battlefields where [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters) and heavy artillery are often present. A Light Discord Missile Launcher fires a single missile at a target on each attack, and the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] feat cannot be used in conjunction with a Light Discord Missile Launcher. Attacks with a Light Discord Missile Launcher on targets smaller than Huge take a -10 penalty on their attack rolls.

When shooting, the gunner makes attack roll against a square within the missile's Range ([Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) 10). If successful, the Light Discord Missile hits target square. If roll fails, missile lands in random adjacent square, the distance from intended target to actual hit spot in character scale squares is equal to how much you failed your attack roll against a square (if you rolled 5 against [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) 10, rocket will land 5 squares away from target). If the square where missile will land is occupied by entity or object, then said entity must dodge, or missile will hit it, as if it was [Tiny](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tiny) [Falling Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Object) that is forced downward (2d6 Bludgeoning damage). Then, regardlessly of whether or not missile hit intended square or if someone was directly hit by missile, one [Buzz Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid) is released from missile and appears in separate square adjacent to the square where missile landed. At [Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale), when the missile breaks open, it releases [Buzz Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid) in target square. At [Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale), missile always hits it's intended square - attack roll against [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) 10 determines if target is directly hit with missile, or if it lands nearby. When a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) enters a square occupied by one or more [Buzz Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid), the [Buzz Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid) can make an immediate melee attack as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) against the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) with an additional +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to their attack rolls. If the attack succeeds, the [Buzz Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid) latches onto the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) and automatically moves when the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) moves. [Buzz Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid) what was deployed from missiles can be controlled, as if they were [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) of the gunner, and are treated as gunner's property. After battle, [Buzz Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid) are multi-use, they return to gunner after battle, can be loaded into missiles via [Missile Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Missile_Load) for 250 credits, or used "as it".

A Light Discord Missile Launcher can only hold a single Light Discord Missile Launcher at any given time. Each Light Discord Missile packed with [Buzz Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Buzz_Droid) costs 11650 credits, and has same weight as the weight as the buzz droid. You can use custom rockets fitted with any item, living creature or [droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/droid), if said payload is [tiny](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/tiny). Cost of such rockets is cost of item/creature/droid + 250 credits.
