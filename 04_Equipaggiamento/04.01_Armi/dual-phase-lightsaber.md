A Dual-Phase Lightsaber is a Lightsaber variant that, at first glance, appears to be identical to a standard [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)), with a small handle emitting an energy blade about 1.3 meters long. However, Dual-Phase Lightsabers include a complex array of multiple [Lightsaber Crystals](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystals) within the handle of the weapon, allowing the user to switch the blade's length from the standard length out to a length of nearly 3 meters.

Dual-Phase Lightsabers are extremely popular during the days of [The Jedi Civil War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Civil_War) and the surrounding time periods due to the large number of [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber)-wielding opponents a Jedi is likely to face. The longer blade setting allows the wielder to keep an opponent at a distance during a duel, but Dual-Phase Lightsabers on this setting are also more unwieldy, making it difficult to defend against opponents that get up close to the wielder.

In its Default Form, a Dual-Phase Lightsaber functions as a normal [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)). As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), the wielder can switch to the Extended Form setting. While on this setting, the Dual-Phase Lightsaber increases the wielder's [Reach](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reach) by 1 square, but the wielder also takes a -2 penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against attacks made by adjacent targets.

If you use a [Lightsaber Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystal) with a special effect when constructing a Dual-Phase Lightsaber, that [Lightsaber Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystal) affects both the Default and Extended Forms of the Dual-Phase Lightsaber (see also Dual-Phase Lightsaber Variants, below).

A Dual-Phase Lightsaber requires a special [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).

## Dual-Phase Lightsaber Variants
Some Jedi adapt the technology behind Dual-Phase Lightsabers to allow them to wield a weapon that uses two different [Lightsaber Crystals](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystals) with different effects. When constructing a Dual-Phase Lightsaber, you can choose a [Lightsaber Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystal) as normal for the Default Form and also apply its properties to its Extended Form.

However, instead of gaining the Extended Form of a normal Dual-Phase Lightsaber, you can instead choose a second [Lightsaber Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystal) with a different effect to add to your Dual-Phase Lightsaber. If you do this, you create two settings for your Dual-Phase Lightsaber with mutually exclusive effects. When you use a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to change the Form of the Dual-Phase Lightsaber, you then gain the benefits of whichever [Lightsaber Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystal) is attuned to that Form.

For example, you might choose an [Ilum Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ilum_Crystal) for your Default Form (Gaining the +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus on attack rolls), and then a [Bondar Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bondar_Crystal) for the Secondary Form (Which converts the weapon's damage to [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage). If your switch from the Default Form to the Secondary Form, you lose the +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus on attack rolls ([Ilum Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ilum_Crystal)) but gain the ability to convert the weapon's normal damage to [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage ([Bondar Crystal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bondar_Crystal)).
