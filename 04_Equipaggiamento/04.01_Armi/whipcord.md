*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Bounty Hunters & Mercenaries (Part 1)*

The Whipcord is a short range snare weapon designed largely to immobilize creatures for capture, though they are also popular with bounty hunters who seek to capture sentient beings as well.

The cable is smartrope, and when small sensors in the tip detect a suitable target, such as arms, legs, torso's or beams, the rope will automatically wrap around the target in an attempt to ensnare them.

On a successful ranged attack, you make make a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check against your target as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). Success puts your opponent in the [Grappled](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grappled) state, and if the attacker has the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/pin.md|Pin]] or [Trip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trip) Feats, they may use them against this opponent. [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/crush.md|Crush]], [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rancor-crush.md|Rancor Crush]], [Throw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Throw), and [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/knock-heads.md|Knock Heads]] are not viable Feats for use with the Whipcord.

The attacker may also try to drag his opponent with an opposed [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check, moving the opponent 1 square for every point they succeed by, to a maximum of their move speed.
