More primitive version of [Vibroknucklers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibroknucklers), these gloves include hidden tiny blades. Such weapons are DIY more often than not, incorporating nails, glass and plastic shards, actual razor blades, sharpened pieces of metal and other junk; though factory-made versions also exist.

Like [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/combat-gloves.md|Combat Gloves]], Razor knucklers are two sizes smaller than their wearer (for example, Vibroknucklers designed for a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] are Tiny). Because of how they are worn, Razor knucklers can't be [Disarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarmed) or dropped. Additionally, while wearing Razor knucklers, your [Unarmed Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_Attacks) are considered to be both a normal [Unarmed Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_Attack) as well as an attack with an [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee)).
