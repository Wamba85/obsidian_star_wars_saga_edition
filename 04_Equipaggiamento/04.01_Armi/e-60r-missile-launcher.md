*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

This lightweight and versatile missile launcher was developed by the [Geonosians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosians) for use by Battle Droids during the Clone Wars. It is capable of handling a variety of payloads and became heavily used by Droid infantry for anti-air and anti-walker objectives. 

The E-60R accepts a variety of ordnance, accommodating 7 missiles per clip and requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to reload. 
- The stock payload is an Anti-Vehicle Missile that can be fired from this launcher, which deals 4d10 damage with a 1-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius.
- An Anti-Personnel Projectile can also be fired, which deals 3d8 damage over a 4-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius.
- Finally, an Anti-Aircraft Homing Projectile can be used with the E-60R which deals 3d10 damage with a 2-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius.
    - If the Anti-Air Projectiles are [Aimed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aimed) in the round prior to firing, they will acquire a target-lock and track its target independently. If the first attack misses, on the following round the rocket makes a second attack using the same attack bonus, but with a -5 penalty (You do not need to spend an [Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Action) to make this attack). If the missile misses a second time, it detonates harmlessly.
To make an attack with the E-60R, make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of all targets within the [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Any targets successfully hit by the projectile take full damage, while missed targets take half damage. Any target with the [**Evasion**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion) Talent takes half damage on a hit, and no damage on a miss.
