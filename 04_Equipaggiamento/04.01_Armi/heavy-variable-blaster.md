The heavier version of the [Variable Blaster](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Variable_Blaster) functions almost identically to its smaller counterpart, but is capable of much higher damage and also includes the same technology used in the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/ascension-gun.md|Ascension Gun]] to create [Syntherope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Syntherope) tethers.

The Clone Trooper's favored Blaster Rifle, the BlasTech DC-15A, is an example of a Heavy Variable Blaster Rifle. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can switch the Weapon from Blaster mode to Ascension mode. When fired in Ascension mode, the Weapon shoots a grappling dart attached to the [Syntherope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Syntherope), tethering the weapon to the target.

In Ascension mode, the Heavy Variable Blaster Rifle has a maximum Range of 30 squares (45 meters). If the tether is projected vertically, the Heavy Variable Blaster Rifle can pull the wielder upward at a speed of 12 squares per round, with a maximum vertical lift capacity of roughly 720 kg.

A Heavy Variable Blaster Rifle can also be used to create a zipline to a target surface after the [Syntherope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Syntherope) has been secured to a fixed object at the shooter's location. The zipline allows the wielder to slide along the line at a speed of 12 squares per round if the destination has a lower elevation.

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can adjust the weapon's power level up or down. You can adjust the weapon's base damage to 3d8, but doing so causes the weapon to consume ten times more shots per attack. Likewise, you can adjust the Weapon's base damage to 3d10, but doing so causes the weapon to consume twenty times more shots per attack.

For example, attacking with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] feat normally consumes 2 shots from a blaster. On its weakest setting (3d6 damage), each [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] attack with a Heavy Variable Blaster Rifle consumes 2 of the Rifle's 500 shots; if the Rifle is set to 3d8 damage, each attack with [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] consumes 20 of the Rifle's 500 shots (2x10# 20); if the Rifle is set to 3d10 damage, each attack with [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] consumes 40 of the Rifle's 500 shots (2x2040).

A Heavy Variable Blaster Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 500 shots, the Weapon's [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
