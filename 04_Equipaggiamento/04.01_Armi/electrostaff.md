An Electrostaff is a double weapon: Each end has an electromagnetic pulse generator that discharges upon impact, allowing it to deal blunt-force wounds. If desired, either electromagnetic pulse can be set to [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) its target instead.

The staff is made of a resilient Phrik alloy that gives it [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) 20; this [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) applies even against [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) attacks. Electrostaffs are not common except during the Clone Wars. The [IG-100 MagnaGuard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/IG-100_MagnaGuard) typically carries an Electrostaff.

An Electrostaff is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).

An Electrostaff requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate.
