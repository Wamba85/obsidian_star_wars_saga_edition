*Hand Claws Equipment data created by Wikia user Darthauthor.*

Hand Claws were originally designed with a nonmartial purpose in mind. First used as an aid for climbing (the metal claws dig into duracrete and use barbed tips to maintain a grip), the tools were later adapted for combat during infiltration missions and other close combat situations.

[The Mistryl Shadow Guard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mistryl_Shadow_Guard) adapted the climbing claws to function as a deadly weapon, more lethal than a knife, but without the noise and flash of a blaster.

Hand Claws provide a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to [Climb](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climb) checks. Additionally, attempts to [Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm) a wielder of their Hand Claws suffer a -5 penalty to the attempt.
