*Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber weapon data created by unknown Wikia user.*

A Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber is a pair of [Dueling Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dueling_Lightsabers) fused at their hilts. This weapon is rare even by the standards of Lightsabers, requiring finesse beyond that of a typical duelist. Do to the smaller size of its base blades, a Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber is only Medium in size, allowing its use supported by offhand weapons or tools.

With both blades ignited, a Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties). Alternatively, when you wield a Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber one-handed, you gain a +1 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on attack rolls whenever you make an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) with the weapon.

A Double-Bladed Lightsaber requires two special [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate (the cost of each is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).

When purchasing a Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber second-hand, rather than by special order or building one yourself (a Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber has a Build DC of 25, with a component cost of 3,000), its cost will likely instead be similar to that of a typical [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/double-bladed-lightsaber.md|Double-Bladed Lightsaber]] (7,000). Despite the weapon's more versatile design, the average seller simply lacks the technical knowledge to distinguish a Dueling Double-Bladed Lightsaber from its more common model.
