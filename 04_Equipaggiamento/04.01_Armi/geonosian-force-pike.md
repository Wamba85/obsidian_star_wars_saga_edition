This powerful double-bladed Force Pike was created by Gordarl Weaponsmiths as a deadly weapon in the hands of [Geonosians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosians). Typically used to stab at enemies from above or in aerial duels in the [Geonosis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosis) execution arena, the pike became feared by the Clone Troopers who served during the Clone Wars.

A Geonosian Force Pike is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (Although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).

A Geonosian Force Pike requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
