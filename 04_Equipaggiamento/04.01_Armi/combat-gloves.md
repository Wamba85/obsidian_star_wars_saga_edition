A pair of padded gloves provides extra hitting power thanks to their weight and the materials used to construct them. Anyone who expects to get into a fistfight or a brawl probably wants to wear Combat Gloves. They provide a +1 bonus to damage on a successful [Unarmed Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_Attack).

Combat Gloves are two sizes smaller than their wearer (for example, a pair of Combat Gloves designed for a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] are Tiny). Because of how they are worn, Combat Gloves can't be [Disarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarmed) or dropped.
