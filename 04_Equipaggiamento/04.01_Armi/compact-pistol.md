*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Compact pistols are the slugthrower equivalents of hold-out blasters, easily concealable and useful as backup weapons. Compact pistols fire standard slugthrower rounds, though typically at lower velocities due to the shorter barrel. Their low ammunition capacity makes for especially frequent reloading. Undercover agents and stealthy operatives typically carry concealed compact pistols when blaster detection equipment is present, or when the need to carry a small , suppressor equipped weapon is of importance.

Because of it's design, a compact pistol grants a +5 equipment bonus on stealth checks made to conceal the weapon. A compact pistol requires a magazine to operate. After 6 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
