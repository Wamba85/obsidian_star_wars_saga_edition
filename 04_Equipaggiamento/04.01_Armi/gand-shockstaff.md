*Gand Shockstaff Equipment data created by Wikia user Possibly Me.*

Used by the famous Gand Findsmen, the Gand Shockstaff is a powerful weapon whose stunning capability is backed up by a sharp tip. Although originally used for herding prey, the Gand Shockstaff can deliver a powerful electrical charge in combat. 

When a Gand Shockstaff moves a target down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) with its [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage, that target has its speed halved until it returns to its normal state (all [Conditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Conditions) removed); a target that is -4 steps down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) is [Immobilized](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Immobilized) instead. 

Although the Gand Shockstaff is considered an [Exotic Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Melee)), any character with the **[Findsman Ceremonies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Findsman_Ceremonies)** Talent may treat it as a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee)) for the sake of proficiency and prerequisites. A Gand Shockstaff is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).

A Gand Shockstaff requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
