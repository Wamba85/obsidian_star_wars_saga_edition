Worn on the wrist and usually concealed by clothing, this Weapon fires toxic darts. Deliah Blue often uses a Concealed Dart Launcher to bring down her targets quickly and without causing lethal damage. A dart can be filled with Contact [Poisons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poisons), but by default it contains a potent sedative that effectively deals [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage to the target. Unlike weapons set to [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun), a Concealed Dart Launcher can deal [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage to targets farther than 6 squares away.

A Concealed Dart Launcher is treated as a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) for purposes of determining [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). Because of its compact design, a Concealed Dart Launcher grants a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks to conceal the Weapon.

A Concealed Dart Launcher requires a bundle of darts to operate, each costing 50 credits and weighing 0.3 kilograms. After 6 shots, the bundle must be replaced.
