Razor Bugs are small, disc-shaped insects engineered by the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] to serve as ranged Weapons. Though they are thrown by hand, Razor Bugs are shaped in such a way that they fly with great speed, distance, and accuracy, making them an effective replacement for longer-ranged Weapons.

A thrown Razor Bug is treated as a [Simple Weapon (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Ranged)), not a [Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown_Weapon), for purposes of determining [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).
