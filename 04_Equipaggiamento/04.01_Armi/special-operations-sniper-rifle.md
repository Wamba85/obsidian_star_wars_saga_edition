*Special Operations Sniper Rifle Equipment data created by Wikia user JediPorg12.*

A long range variation of the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/special-operations-blaster-system.md|Special Operations Blaster System]], it has the same modifications without the [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire). It is still a very very complicated system, requiring the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/exotic-weapon-proficiency.md|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]] feat to have proficiency in the SORS.

Due to its more rifle-like structure, however, the SORS is treated as a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles) for the purposes of [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), as well as satisfying [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) and [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) prerequisites. It takes +1 to attacks on targets more than 66 squares far from wielder.

Unwieldy in anything other than a prepared firing position, the Special Operations Sniper Rifle is poorly suited for use in close combat. If you do not [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) at your target immediately before making an attack with a SORS, you take a -5 penalty on your attack roll.

A Special Operations Sniper Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 50 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
