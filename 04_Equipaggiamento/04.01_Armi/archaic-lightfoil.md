Lighter than the average [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)) and more delicately balanced, the Archaic Lightfoil is wielded with only one hand and was once the favored weapon of many Jedi dueling masters. Originally created by Sith agents in the Tapani Sector, Lightfoils promote a more graceful fighting style and are favored by practitioners of the **[Makashi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Makashi)** style of Lightsaber combat. Popular in the years leading up to [The Great Sith War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Sith_War), the Lightfoil in its original form was created in much the same way as other Lightsabers and benefited from the builder's mastery of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).

An Archaic Lightfoil is delicately balanced, and its wielder can choose to consider it a Small weapon whenever it would be beneficial. However, an Archaic Lightfoil cannot be wielded Two-Handed.

An Archaic Lightfoil requires a special [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).
