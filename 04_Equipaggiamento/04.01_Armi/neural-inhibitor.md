The Mennotor DAS-430 Neural Inhibitor is a powered, ranged weapon that uses some of the same technology as rail guns to propel a high-velocity dart at the target, which imbeds itself into the skin. The dart then injects a special neurotoxin that can bring down even the toughest enemies.

When a living target is hit by an attack with a Neural Inhibitor, the target is poisoned and the dart makes an attack roll (1d20+5) against the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). If the attack succeeds, the target moves -1 step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). If the attack fails, the target does not move down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), but the dart's next attack gains a cumulative +1 bonus (so it attacks with 1d20+5 originally, 1d20+6 after the first failure, 1d20+7 after the second failure, etc.).

The target's [Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition) is considered [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) until the poison is treated, and the poison makes an attack roll at the beginning of the target's turn until the poison is cured with a DC 20 [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check. Once the target falls unconscious, the neurotoxin dissipates on its own.

A Neural Inhibitor requires darts, and only can hold only one dart at a time. Each dart costs 5 credits.
