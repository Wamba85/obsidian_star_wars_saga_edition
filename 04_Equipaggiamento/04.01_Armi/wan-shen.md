The Wan-Shen is a tall polearm wielded by [The Matukai](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Matukai) as their Weapon of choice and their external focus for [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). The Weapon consists of a single-edged blade at the end of a long, metal shaft, both of which are made of a hard but lightweight metal. The blade is forged and sculpted with assistance from [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), making it extraordinarily resilient.

Although all Wan-Shen are constructed the same, each Weapon is customized by the individual Matukai who uses it in the form of engraved symbols and artwork on the blade, usually symbolizing something meaningful to the wielder.

Wan-Shen are designed to break down into smaller parts to allow the Weapon to be more easily stored and carried; a disassembled Wan-Shen breaks down into four Small objects. Assembling or disassembling a Wan-Shen is a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). A Wan-Shen increases the wielder's [Reach](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reach) by 1 square.

A Wan-Shen is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).
