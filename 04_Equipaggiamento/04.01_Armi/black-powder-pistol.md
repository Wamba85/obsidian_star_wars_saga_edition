The Black-Powder Pistol's usage or possession is rarely regulated, because it is considered antique on most worlds. Although reloading the weapon is slow and the weapon has a limited [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), its main benefit is that knowledgeable explorers can usually scrounge together the materials to produce ammunition no matter where in the galaxy they might be. 

Black-Powder Pistols are notoriously finicky and require frequent maintenance. Many a spacer forced to use an ill-kept Black Powder Pistol has had it literally fizzle on him or her. 

A Black-Powder Pistol must be reloaded after each shot and requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to reload, preventing the use of any [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) or [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) that allow multiple shots. Ammunition can be purchased in sets of 50 shots and costs 5 credits per set. 

A character [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) can attempt to forage for supplies to make his or her own ammunition, requiring a DC 20 [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check to search the area for the necessary materials. One hour and a DC 15 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check can produce enough ammunition for 5 shots, and an extra 5 shots are produced for every 5 points by which the check result exceeds the DC.
