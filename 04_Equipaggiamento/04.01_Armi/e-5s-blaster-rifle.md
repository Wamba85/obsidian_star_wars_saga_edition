The E-5s Blaster Rifle was created by Baktoid Armor Workshop to be used by specially programmed Assassin Droids. The weapon takes advantage of the unnaturally steady hands of Droid snipers, providing extreme range and accuracy. The new addition to Separatist Forces was a great success, stalling Republic military efforts on many planets as Clone Commanders were picked off, unprepared to counter sniper-tactics from an enemy that had shown a preference for much more straightforward open-field warfare.

Perhaps the most famous use of this weapon during the Clone Wars was on [Muunilinst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Muunilinst) against invading Republic Special Forces. While the weapon was unable to win the engagement for the Separatists, it did impede the deadly ARC Troopers for a time. The delay caused untold death and damage to Republic Orbital units, who were dependent on the ARC force to disable the planetary guns.

The E-5s Blaster Rifle is capable of 5 shots before it needs to be reloaded. The high-powered rifle uses standard [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs).
