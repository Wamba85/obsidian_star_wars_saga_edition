These small explosives were used by [Clone Commandos](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Commandos) in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Flashbangs, as they were aptly nicknamed, emit a bright flash of light and a loud bang on detonation.

When making an attack with a Diversionary Flash Detonator, make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target within the weapon’s 2-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius.

Any target successfully hit by the blast is [Blinded](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blinded) for 1d4 rounds. Missed targets are considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) for the remainder of the round. A target with the [**Evasion**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion) Talent is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) on a hit, and suffers no ill-effect on a miss.

Targets with specialized visual and auditory protection, such as [Photon-Shielding Visors/Photoreceptors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Photon-Shielding_Visors/Photoreceptors) and [Sound Dampeners](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sound_Dampeners), or [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) that only see outside the visible spectrum are unaffected by this weapon.
