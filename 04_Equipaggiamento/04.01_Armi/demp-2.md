*DEMP 2 weapon data created by Wikia user DX-2052.*

The Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. Destructive Electromagnetic Pulse 2 (DEMP 2) is an unusual model of Ion Rifle that also functions as a stun weapon against living targets and has above average power. As a trade off for this capability, the DEMP 2 suffers from a slow rate of fire at max power, low power on lower settings, and quickly consumes [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs).

Attacks made with a DEMP 2 against Droids, Vehicles, electronic devices, cybernetically enhanced creatures or targets more than 20 squares away is treated as [Ion Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion_Damage), while attacks made against all other targets within 20 squares is treated as [Stun Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Damage). As a Swift Action, you can prime a DEMP 2 for a built-up shot. If you make no attacks with the DEMP 2 before the start of your next turn, the next attack you make with it before the end of the encounter deals 4d8 damage (instead of the normal 2d6) and consumes 5 charges.

You may not use any ability that consumes more than one shot (such as [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) in conjunction with a primed shot. A DEMP 2 requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 10 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
