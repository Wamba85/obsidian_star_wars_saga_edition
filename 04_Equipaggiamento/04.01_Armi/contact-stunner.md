Frequently sold as a personal protection device, the Contact Stunner is a small, inconspicuous weapon, the forward end of which is covered with over a dozen contact disks, enabling it to deliver a concentrated and, therefore, effective discharge when it contacts a target. However, the Weapon's lack of mass makes it less useful for anything other than rendering a target unconscious.

Because of its slender and compact design, a Contact Stunner grants a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks made to conceal the weapon. A Contact Stunner requires an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
