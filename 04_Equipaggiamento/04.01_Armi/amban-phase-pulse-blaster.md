*Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster weapon data created by Wikia user Elitesqadron.*

A dangerous and often illegal weapon anywhere within civilized space, the Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster is an effective disruptor weapon popular with outlaws and fringers in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). Its deadly blasts and attached energy prongs allow a seasoned fringer to maintain deadly fire without leaving themselves vulnerable.

As a disruptor weapon, the Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster treats all targets as if their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) was 5 points lower than it is. If damage from the Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster kills a creature or destroys an object, [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), or [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), that target is disintegrated and ceases to exist. You cannot use any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent), or other special ability that consumes more than one shot from the weapon per round (such as [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) with a Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster.

Amban Phase-Pulse Blasters incorporate a [Stun Baton](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Baton) within the forward prongs of the barrel, allowing a wielder to make [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity) with the weapon (dealing 2d6 [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage, as normal).

An Amban Phase-Pulse Blaster requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After each individual shot, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
