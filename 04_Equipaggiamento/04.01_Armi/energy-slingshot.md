*Energy Slingshot Equipment data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

A wrist-mounted device favored by pranksters and the youth of many [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), the Energy Slingshot is used by pointing the device at a target and pulling back on an energized cup. A non-lethal tool, it is legal to possess on most worlds throughout the galaxy, even during the reign of the Empire.

Unlike Stun bolts, the slingshot projectiles are subject to gravitation, and traveled in a parabolic arc. As such, abilities that affect [Grenades](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grenades) (such as the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/angled-throw.md|Angled Throw]] feat) may be used with the Energy Slingshot.

An Energy Slingshot requires an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate. Due to its unique manufacturing, the Energy Cell does not typical require a replacement within the Energy Slingshot's lifespan.
