The Flame Cannon is a larger version of the regular [Flamethrower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flamethrower), with a considerably longer range, hotter temperature, and greater fuel capacity. Examples include the Merr-Sonn Model CR-28 and the Czerka CZ-28 Flamestrike. Mounted on ground [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) or tripods, the Flame Cannon is ideal for clearing out bunkers or as a weapon of shock and terror.

When mounted on a tripod, the Flame Cannon is treated as one size smaller for purposes of being wielded, allowing a Medium character to operate it with two hands. The Flame Cannon shoot a [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone) of burning chemicals 12 squares long and 8 squares wide at the terminus.

Make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target within this area. A successful attack deals 5d6 points of [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage to the target. If the attack misses, the target instead takes half damage. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent takes half damage from a successful attack and no damage if the attack misses. The normal rules for taking [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage apply.

Reloading a Flame Cannon is a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). The weapon can be used 20 times before its chemical supply is depleted. Replacement tanks for the Flame Cannon cost 600 credits and weigh 20 kg each.
