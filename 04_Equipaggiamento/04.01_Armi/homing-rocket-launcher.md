This extremely bulky rocket launcher was developed by the [Wookiees](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiees) of [Kashyyyk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyyyk). It is capable of firing rockets that can home in on their targets either individually, or in a single, five-rocket barrage.

Firing this weapon requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). When making an attack with this weapon in Single-Fire Mode, make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of all targets within the rocket’s 2-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius. If the primary target is hit, it takes full damage, otherwise it takes half damage. Targets within the [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius take half damage on a successful hit, and no damage on a miss. Primary targets with the [**Evasion**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion) Talent take half damage on a hit, no damage on a miss.

If the Homing Rocket Launcher is [Aimed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aimed) in the round prior to firing, the rocket will acquire a target-lock and track its target independently. If the first attack misses, on the following round the rocket makes a second attack using the same attack bonus, but with a -5 penalty (You do not need to spend an [Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Action) to make this attack). If the rocket misses a second time, it detonates harmlessly.

When making an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with this weapon in Barrage Mode, unlike a standard [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack), the weapon targets a 3x3-Square area, albeit at an additional -5 penalty to the attack roll. The rockets cannot utilize the homing feature when fired in barrage mode, and effectively carry no [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) damage.

A [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 14 or greater is required to fire this weapon in combat; otherwise the wielder incurs a -5 penalty on all attack rolls made with this weapon. The Homing Rocket Launcher holds five rockets, facilitating a single Barrage mode shot, or five Single-Fire shots. Reloading this weapon takes three [Full-Round Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Actions). The rockets used in this weapon cost 150 credits each, and weigh 1 kg.
