The Minimag is an extremely adaptable missile launching system that saw widespread usage during the Clone Wars. Although its targeting system is the most basic- only capable of "Dumb-Firing" its ordnance- the MiniMag is capable of handling virtually any type of missile or torpedo. Using special field-kit adapters (approximately 200 credits each), the launcher can be refitted with a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to accommodate different payloads.
