The DXR-6 is a Disruptor Rifle built by [The Tenloss Syndicate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tenloss_Syndicate). It is a larger version of the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/disruptor-pistol.md|Disruptor Pistol]], and it has the same legal and social issues associated with its use.

As a Disruptor weapon, the Disruptor Rifle treats all targets as if their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) was 5 points lower than it is. If damage from the Disruptor Rifle kills or destroys a target, that target is disintegrated and ceases to exist.

Because of the massive energy required to create a Disruptor beam, the Disruptor Rifle can fire only once every other round. You cannot use any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent), or other special ability that consumes more than one shot from the weapon per round (such as [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) with a Disruptor Rifle.

A Disruptor Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 10 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be recharged.
