The designers at Gee-Tech exchanged range and damage to create the galaxy's smallest blaster. In fact, the Gee-Tech 12 Defender MicroBlaster is so small that it grants its wielder a +5 bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks to conceal it. 

The Defender MicroBlaster is light on energy because it carries only enough power for two shots, with a maximum [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) of 3 squares. A bigger disadvantage is that the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) is integrated into the weapon and cannot be recharged once its two shots are spent, making it a truly disposable weapon.
