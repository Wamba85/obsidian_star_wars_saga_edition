A nasty Weapon deemed by many to be unnecessarily painful, the Shock Whip has been used by warriors throughout the galaxy for generations. Fast and cruel, the Shock Whip is the chosen Weapon of [The Mistryl Shadow Guard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mistryl_Shadow_Guard) and is also used by Sith Lord Darth Maleval. A Shock Whip consists of a metal grip from which extend long, thick wires woven together into a single strand. The metal grip houses an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) that can send a surge of energy through the Shock Whip's cord, issuing an electric shock to the target.

A Shock Whip is a Melee Weapon with a reach of 2 squares. When you hit with a Shock Whip, the target takes normal damage from the Weapon. Also on a hit, you can choose to make a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack (as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action)) against the target using the whip, provided the target is no more than one size category larger than you.

Unlike a normal [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack, you make a second attack roll at the normal attack bonus with the Shock Whip, and you do not take a -5 penalty on the attack roll. If this second attack roll hits, the target is [Grabbed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grabbed). As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn, you can automatically deal 2d6 energy damage to a target [Grabbed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grabbed) by the Shock Whip (no additional attack roll required).

If you have the [Trip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trip) feat, you can choose to use the Shock Whip to knock the target [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) instead of making a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack. While [Grabbing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grabbing) a target with the Shock Whip, you cannot use the Weapon to make attacks against any other targets.

A Shock Whip requires an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
