*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Revolvers are ancient examples of slugthrower technology, using revolving cylinders instead of magazines to hold ammunition. Revolvers are generally heavier than most pistols and require a much longer time to reload. While somewhat inefficient compared to modern slugthrower technology, revolvers are sometimes used by those with a fascination for history or by gunslingers who may have watched one too many holovid action sequences.

A revolver can be reloaded by hand or with a special speed-loading ring (included in the weapons cost). Reloading a revolver by hand requires a full-round action; using a speed-loading ring requires only a move action. Revolvers fire 6 shots before requiring a reload.
