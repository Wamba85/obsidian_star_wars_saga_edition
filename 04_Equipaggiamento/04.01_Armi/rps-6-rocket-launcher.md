*RPS-6 Rocket Launcher* *data created by Wikia user Elitesqadron.*

Created by Merr-Sonn Munitions, the RPS-6 Rocket Launcher is a common anti-[Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) weapons used during the Clone Wars. Used by both [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) and [The Confederacy of Independent Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems), the RPS-6 is particularly favored for its 6-rocket capacity, allowing the user to repeatedly fire without reloading. A rocket fired from a RPS-6 Rocket Launcher affects all targets within a 2-square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius.

When you make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with a RPS-6 Rocket Launcher, you make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the Weapon's [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Creatures you hit take full damage, and creatures you miss take half damage. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses.

A RPS-6 Rocket Launcher holds six rockets, and can be reloaded as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). Replacement rockets are bought in pre-loaded magazines that hold four rockets. Magazines cost 250 credits, and weigh 7 kg.
