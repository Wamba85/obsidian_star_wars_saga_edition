Sidearm Blaster Pistol is the generic term for Blaster Pistols that have a high ammunition efficiency rating. Created by BlasTech Industries under contract for the Grand Army of the Republic, the DC-15s Sidearm Blaster is a favorite backup weapon carried by [Clone Commandos](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Commandos).

Although the shots that it fires are as powerful as those of other blasters, the Sidearm Blaster Pistol's slow recharge rate enforces conservation of ammunition, which can be advantageous in a prolonged firefight or when the wielder finds themselves behind enemy lines without access to additional [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs).

A Sidearm Blaster Pistol requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. If you use a Sidearm Blaster Pistol with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] feat or any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) that has [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] as a prerequisite, you must spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to reset the weapon's trigger before it can be fired again. This feature and the special energy-trickle technology allow the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to last for 250 shots.
