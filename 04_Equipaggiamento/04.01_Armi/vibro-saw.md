A large and cumbersome variation of the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/vibro-axe.md|Vibro-Axe]], a Vibro-Saw is typically used to cut down large vegetation such as trees and exceptionally thick vine clusters. However, its impressive cutting power has led the Vibro-Saw to be used to cut through bulkheads in boarding actions by military units and pirates alike. The Vibro-Saw also has the distinct advantage of being legal in areas where the possession of any other type of Vibro weapon is a criminal offense. 

A Vibro-Saw ignores a target's [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction). A Vibro-Saw requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate.
