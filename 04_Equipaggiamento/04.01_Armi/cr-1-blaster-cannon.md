The Golan Arms CR-1 Blaster Cannon was originally developed for use in big game hunting popular in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). Using special faceted lenses, the CR-1 fractures the blaster bolt into several lower-powered bolts in a spread pattern, providing a better chance to hit a target. During test stages, however, it was noted that the weapon was much more potent than conventional blasters at close range.

As such, the weapon was militarized during the Clone Wars and saw limited use. When the war drew to a close, the remaining stock of CR-1’s were crated and stored at a Golan Arms warehouse in the Ac’Fren Spur. Decades later, the depot was raided by [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) forces who adopted the weapon in their fight against [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire).

The CR-1 Blaster Cannon fires a spread of five blaster bolts in a 5x10-Square [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack). Make a single attack roll and compare it with the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target within this area. A successful attack on targets within 2 squares deals 4d8 damage; within 5 squares the attack deals 2d8 damage; and within 10 squares the attack deals 1d8 damage.

The CR-1 Blaster Cannon can be fired 5 times before it requires reloading- using a standard [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) and [Gas Canister](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gas_Canister) to operate. After 100 shots, the [Gas Canister](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gas_Canister) must be replaced.
