*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Submachine guns, often referred to as sub-repeaters or machine pistols, are small, compact weapons used for personal defense and close quarters fighting. They fall into the middle ground between pistols and rifles and are more useful where neither of those is inappropriate. They can have either retractable or fixed stocks depending on the model and are capable of full-automatic fire. Submachine guns generally use pistol ammunition, but have operating systems nearly identical to those of rifles. Due to their shot-barreled design, submachine guns are generally ineffective are longer ranges.

A submachine gun requires a magazine to operate. After 40 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
