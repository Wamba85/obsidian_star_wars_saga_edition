*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

This ornately detailed ceremonial Blaster Rifle is commonplace among the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/pau-an.md|Pau'an]] warriors, even some [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/utai.md|Utai]], on the planet of [Utapau](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Utapau) during the Clone Wars. The rifles were typically handed down across the generations, serving as a status symbol. Unfortunately, this meant that the weapons were hopelessly obsolete by the time of the Clone Wars, and posed little threat to neither the invading Droid Army nor the Clone Army after Order 66 was executed.

The HB-9 Blaster Rifle uses a standard [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) that must be replaced after 25 shots, and a [Gas Canister](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gas_Canister) that must be replaced after 200 shots.
