The projectile equivalent of a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/heavy-blaster-pistol.md|Heavy Blaster Pistol]], the Heavy Slugthrower Pistol uses a larger round than a [Slugthrower Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Slugthrower_Pistol), creating greater stopping power at the cost of increased recoil, which makes accurate firing of several shots in rapid succession a difficult prospect. 

In spite of this lack of accuracy, the Heavy Slugthrower Pistol does provide a psychological advantage, both because of its large size as well as the loud report it makes when fired, something to be considered when dealing with a skittish group of unfriendly natives. 

If you use the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]], [Triple Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Triple_Attack), or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] feats with a Heavy Slugthrower Pistol, you take an additional -1 penalty to attack rolls. A Heavy Slugthrower Pistol uses an ammo clip instead of a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack). After 8 shots, the clip must be replaced. A clip costs 15 credits and weighs 0.1 kg.
