The Thermal Detonator is a fist-sized sphere containing baradium, a powerful explosive. Outlawed throughout known space except for highly regulated demolitions professionals, the Thermal Detonator produces a fusion reaction that generates a rapidly expanding field of searing heat and blast energy.

Disguised as a bounty hunter, Princess Leia threatened Jabba the Hutt with a Thermal Detonator at the beginning of *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi*.

A Thermal Detonator's timer can be set from 6 seconds (1 round), to as high as an 18-second delay (3 rounds), counting down until it explodes, or is reset to its safe position.

When you make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with a Thermal Detonator, you make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the grenade's 4-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Creatures hit take full damage, and creatures missed take half damage.

A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense).
