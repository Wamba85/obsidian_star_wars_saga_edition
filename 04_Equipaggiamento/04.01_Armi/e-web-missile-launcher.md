A variant of the [E-Web Repeating Blaster](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/E-Web_Repeating_Blaster), the E-Web Missile Launcher consists of a heavy, tripod-mounted firing mechanism from which missiles are launched. When mounted on a tripod, it is treated as one size smaller for purposes of being wielded (allowing a Medium character to operate it with two hands). 

An E-Web Missile Launcher operates only in Single-Fire mode, though it does not require a [Power Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Generator). An E-Web Missile Launcher is an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) Weapon that damages all targets in a 2-square by 2-square area. 

When you make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with an E-Web Missile Launcher, you make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the Weapon's [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Creatures you hit take full damage, and creatures you miss take half damage. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses. 

Usually, a second crewmember is required to reload an E-Web Missile Launcher between shots, jamming a live missile into the launch tube as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action). An E-Web Missile Launcher can fire only a single shot each round, after which the Weapon must be reloaded.

The wielder of an E-Web Missile Launcher can spend two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) in the same round immediately before making an attack to treat the [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) to the target as though it were one step shorter (Short becomes Point-Blank, Medium becomes Short, and so forth); this benefit stacks with the effect of the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/far-shot.md|Far Shot]] Feat.

The missiles fired by an E-Web Missile Launcher cost 75 credits each.
