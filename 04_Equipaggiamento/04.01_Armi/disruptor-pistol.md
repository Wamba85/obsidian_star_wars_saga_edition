The DX-2 is a Disruptor Pistol built by the Tenloss Criminal Syndicate. It is [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal) on most worlds and firmly outlawed by the Empire (despite its use by some Imperial Special Forces). Designed to disintegrate what it hits, the DX-2 Disruptor Pistol tears apart targets on a molecular level, leaving gaping wounds when it does not totally eliminate a target. Used by some criminals and thugs, the DX-2 Disruptor Pistol actually became more popular shortly after the end of the Clone Wars.

Many shadowy figures think that if they are going to carry a weapon in defiance of Imperial law, they might as well carry a highly [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal) one- and besides, it's often useful not to leave bodies behind as evidence. Despite this, Disruptor Weapons remain a sign of cruelty and brutality not permitted in many societies, including some criminal organizations.

As a Disruptor weapon, the Disruptor Pistol treats all targets as if their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) was 5 points lower than it is. If damage from the Disruptor Pistol kills or destroys a target, that target is disintegrated and ceases to exist.

Because of the massive energy required to create a Disruptor beam, the Disruptor Pistol can fire only once every other round. You cannot use any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent), or other special ability that consumes more than one shot from the weapon per round (such as [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) with a Disruptor Pistol.

A Disruptor Pistol requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 10 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be recharged.
