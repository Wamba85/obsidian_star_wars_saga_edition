*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Carbines are short-barreled rifles, useful for fighting in tight spaces at close range. Like submachine guns, carbines can have both fixed or retractable stocks and are capable of fully-automatic fire. Carbines use the same ammunition as rifles, making them generally more effective than submachine guns.

A carbine requires a magazine to operate. After 30 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
