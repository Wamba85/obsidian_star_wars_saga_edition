This over-the-shoulder portable missile launcher was used by Republic forces during the Clone Wars. The launcher was specifically designed to home-in on repulsorlift signatures using its Gravity-Activated Mode (GAM).

If the weapon is aimed at a repulsorlift vehicle prior to firing, the rocket will acquire a target-lock and track its target independently. If the first attack misses, on the following round the rocket makes a second attack using the same attack bonus, but with a -5 penalty (you do not need to spend an [Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Action) to make this attack). If the rocket misses a second time, it will make a third attempt the following round, but with a -10 penalty. If the third attack misses, the rocket detonates harmlessly.

The PLX-1 Missile/Rocket Launcher can also fire in the traditional “Dumb-Fire” mode. PLX-1 Missiles have a 2-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Switching between Gravity-Activated Mode and Dumb-Fire mode takes one [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to perform.

When you make an area attack with a launcher, make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the missile’s 2-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Targets hit by the blast take full damage, while missed targets take half damage. A target with the [**Evasion**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion) Talent takes half damage on a hit, and no damage on a miss.

The PLX-1 Missile/Rocket Launcher uses a special missile that must be reloaded using a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) after each shot is fired. The missiles cost 100 credits each and weigh 1 kg.
