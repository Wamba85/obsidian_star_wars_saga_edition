The Flamethrower is a ranged weapon that shoots a cone of burning chemicals in a 6-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone). Make a single attack roll and compare it to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target within this area (this is an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack)). A successful attack deals 3d6 points of [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage to the target; if the attack misses, the target takes half damage instead. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses.

Reloading the Flamethrower is a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). The weapon can be used five times before its chemical supply is depleted. Replacement chemical cartridges for the Flamethrower cost 200 credits, and weigh 4 kg each.
