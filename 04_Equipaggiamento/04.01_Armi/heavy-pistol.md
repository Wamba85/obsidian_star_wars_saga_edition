Heavy pistols came into favor with many law enforcement agencies to defeat heavily armored criminals, but their compact size and heavy firepower have also made them popular with criminal elements, specialty military units and personal defense enthusiasts. While heavy pistol provide massive firepower in a compact package, their low ammunition capacity tends to limit their effectiveness in drawn out combat.

A heavy pistol requires a magazine to operate. After 8 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
