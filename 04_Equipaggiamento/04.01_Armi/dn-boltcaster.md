Drever Corporation originally created the Phoenix II Plasma Disruptor as a means for customs agents to disabled locked hatches and other electronic locking mechanisms. However, when the military discovered that the weapon was particularly effective against Droids, Drever Corporation created the DN Boltcaster to fit the specific needs for militarization.

The weapon fires a massive arc of electricity nearly 20 meters to disable Droids’ systems. During the Clone Wars, the weapon was employed by specialized Clone Troopers.

The weapon does not require ammunition; however, wielders cannot use any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) or other special ability that consumes more than one shot in a round (such as [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) with this weapon. This weapon is also limited to Point-Blank and Short [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) (using the [Ranges](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ranges) of a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol)).

The Boltcaster is capable of dealing damage to living targets, but is much more effective against Droids and cybernetic or electronic equipment, moving them -1 step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) regardless of whether their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) was exceeded.

The DN Boltcaster Plasma Disruptor can also build a stronger electrical bolt by charging its discharge capacitors prior to firing. The wielder can double (4d6) or triple (6d6) the damage dice rolled by spending one or two consecutive [Standard Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Actions) charging the weapon beforehand.
