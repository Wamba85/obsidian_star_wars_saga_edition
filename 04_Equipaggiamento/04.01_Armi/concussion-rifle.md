A powerful if uncommon weapon, the Concussion Rifle operates by firing a concussive energy charge, creating a powerful shock wave that can knock down a full-grown [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]. The technology required for these weapons is more complex than that used in blaster weapons, so few companies except Arakyd Industries and BlasTech produce them. 

In spite of their rarity, Concussion Rifles are popular with [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/trandoshan.md|Trandoshan]] mercenaries and slavers and are used by several bounty hunters and some unconventional military units. 

A character using this weapon makes an attack roll against the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). If the attack is successful, the target is knocked [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) in addition to the damage dealt by the weapon. A Concussion Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 25 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
