A Saberdart Launcher is a weapon created by the [Kaminoans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kaminoans), and most notably wielded by Jango Fett during the opening stages of the Clone Wars. The darts themselves deal little damage, but the poison they carry is lethal.

When a living creature is damaged by a Kamino Saberdart, the poison in the dart makes an attack roll (1d20+15) against the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). If the attack succeeds, the poison deals 2d6 points of damage, and the target moves -2 steps along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). If the attack fails, the target moves -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). If the target reaches the end of the Condition Track, it dies instead of falling unconscious. The poison attacks each round until the target is cured with a successful DC 25 [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check.

The Saberdart Launcher fires individual specialized Kaminoan Poison Darts, which needs to be reloaded after each shot. Each dart is both [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal) and [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare), and costs 500 credits.
