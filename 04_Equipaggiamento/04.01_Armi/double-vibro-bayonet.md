This is a somewhat egregious bayonet, composed of two small vibro blades on each side of the weapon. They deal more damage when mounted because of firearm's leverage and bulk. When detached, each of them functions like [Vibrodagger](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrodagger); if only 1 of them is attached to weapon, it functions like [Vibrodagger](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrodagger) attached via [Bayonet Ring](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bayonet_Ring).

Double Vibro Bayonet requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate - one for each blade.

A Double Vibro Bayonet is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty; certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties.
