*Krykna Rifle weapon data created by Wikia user TheMightyWagon.*

Modeled off of the oldest types of slugthrowers known to galactic firearm historians, this large rifle is so named for packing a punch that can easily penetrate the tough hides of [Krykna](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Krykna). Thanks to the large size of its ammunition, targets attacked by this weapon from Short or Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) do not benefit from any Natural Armor bonuses to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). Favored by game hunters and hobbyists, the potency of this weapon is offset by its reload time, requiring two [Full-Round Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Actions) to reload a single shot. Its long reload time encourages those using it to choose carefully when to take their only shot.

Krykna Rifles are almost exclusively custom-made, usually by individual craftsmen rather than weapons companies. For example, the legendary hunter Bhuff Tra had hers made by an associate of the antiquities dealer Piltav Ukkor, and, in addition to being built specifically for a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/trandoshan.md|Trandoshan]], came equipped with a [Rangefinder](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rangefinder) and a [Double Trigger](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Double_Trigger). 

Ammunition for Krykna Rifle's are heavy ball-shaped slugs that fit into the large barrel with a small powder charge, each weighing 0.2 kilograms and costing 50 credits each (usually from the same person that made it).
