Assault slugthrower rifles are military weapons capable of inflicting great damage at both short and long ranges. Assault rifles fire their ammunition at very high velocities, serving well against unarmored targets. Most assault rifles are equipped with fixed stocks, adjustable sights and long barrels, making them perfect for open-field engagements.

An assault rifle requires a magazine to operate. After 30 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
