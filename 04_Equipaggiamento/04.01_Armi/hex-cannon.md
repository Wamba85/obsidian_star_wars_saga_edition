Someone, somewhere, thought that it would be a good idea to load [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/flame-cannon.md|Flame Cannon]] with [Hex Weaponry](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hex_Weaponry) - reinforcing it, to make sure it doesn't melt or leak. Mounted on ground vehicles or tripods, such weapon works as great bunker-buster or weapon of terror.

When mounted on a tripod, the Hex Cannon is treated as one size smaller for purposes of being wielded, allowing a Medium character to operate it with two hands. The Hex Cannon shoot a [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone) of toxic chemicals 12 squares long and 8 squares wide at the terminus. Affected squares are hit with long-lasting dangerous chemicals as per [Hex Weaponry](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hex_Weaponry).

Reloading a Hex Cannon is a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). The weapon can be used 20 times before its chemical supply is depleted. Replacement tanks for the Hex Cannon cost 800 credits and weigh 20 kg each. Hex Cannon can also be loaded with tanks from [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/flame-cannon.md|Flame Cannon]], in which case it will work like [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/flame-cannon.md|Flame Cannon]].
