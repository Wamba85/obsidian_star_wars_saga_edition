Predecessor of [Miniature Proton Torpedo Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Miniature_Proton_Torpedo_Launcher), the Miniature Nuclear Torpedo Launcher is pinnacle of Industrial-era personal firepower, firing tiny and rather dirty nuclear bombs. While crude by standards of most civilized worlds, it is nonetheless a very dangerous weapon, still produced on lawless backwater worlds.

When you make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with a Miniature Nuclear Torpedo Launcher, you make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the Weapon's 2-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Creatures you hit take full damage, and creatures you miss take half damage. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses.

Alternatively, the Weapon can be fired at a single target, acting as a focused weapon designed to take out Starfighters and Ground Vehicles. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can set the Miniature Nuclear Torpedo Launcher to single-target mode. In this mode, the weapon no longer functions as an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) Weapon, deals 6d10x2 damage, and applies a -10 penalty on attack rolls against targets smaller than Huge size.

Additionally, creatures in blast radius are hit with Extreme [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation). Things in blast radius are set on [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire). Explosion is deafeningly loud and bright: creatures in 4-Square Burst radius are harmed as per [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/flash-canister.md|Flash Canister]]. After explosion, the 2-Square Burst area is irradiated with lingering radiation; Extreme Radiation, which after 1 hour turns into Severe [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation), which after 7 hours turns into Moderate [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation), which after 8 hours turns into Mild radiation, which after 8 hours finally disperses.

Miniature Nuclear Torpedo Launcher holds 1 nuclear torpedo. Replacement Miniature Nuclear Torpedoes weigh 5 kg and cost 200 credits each.
