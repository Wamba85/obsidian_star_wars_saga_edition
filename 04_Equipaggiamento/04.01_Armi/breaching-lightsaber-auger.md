*Breaching Lightsaber Auger weapon data created by unknown Wikia user.*

A Breaching Lightsaber Auger is a gruesomely devastating weapon for uncivilized age, and is one of many [Experimental Lightsaber Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Experimental_Lightsaber_Weapons). It consists of a system what combines the power of 33 [Dueling Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dueling_Lightsabers) into a massive auger-shaped beam.

The length of beam can be regulated, and on the biggest setting, its truly massive. A Breaching Lightsaber Auger provides a [Reach](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reach) of 33 squares at [Character Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Scale). Due to beam's large size, the weapon has a 33-square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius- except, those who [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dodge.md|Dodge]] or get missed by attack receive no damage (instead of half damage usual to [Area Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks)), and its user can determine what targets are affected by the attack (excluding those they don't wish to damage). Each target rolls it's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) separately.

To function, a Breaching Lightsaber Auger requires 33 [Dueling Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dueling_Lightsabers)- each of those requires a special [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate (the cost of each is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely). Due to the weapon's configuration, a Breaching Lightsaber Auger's technique differs from that used by most [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers); a user can weild it as either a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) or [Advanced Melee Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapon), whichever would be more beneficial for them.
