*Large Club weapon data created by Wikia user TheMightyWagon.*

A favorite of larger, more barbaric [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) that can capitalize on their size difference, this is a much bigger version of the common [Club](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Club). Although it might be unwieldy, an individual of persuasive size carrying this openly can sometimes circumvent its use entirely.

Its size and heft demand a good deal of strength to wield, and as such, creatures with a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 15 or less that attempt to attack with this weapon do so at a -5 penalty. Further, its large size means you can only make one proper attack per turn, with every attack after the first (including [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity)) taking a cumulative -2 penalty until the start of your next turn.
