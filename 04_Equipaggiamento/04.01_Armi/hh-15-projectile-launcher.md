The Golan Arms HH-15 Projectile Launcher is commonly used by [Rebel Vanguards](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Vanguards). Though old and somewhat outdated, it is still dependable and potent enough to crack through enemy fortifications. The shoulder-fired rocket launcher can launch various payloads (most often an armor-piercing shell), and its rugged design is capable of operating in extreme climates and conditions. Unlike more common antipersonnel missile launchers, the HH-15 is optimized for antiarmor duty. Its detonation is compact and less prone to causing collateral damage, but making it less useful against concentrations of enemy infantry. While lacking the more sophisticated targeting systems found on Imperial missile launchers, it can acquire a target lock if the operator [Aims](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aims) before making an attack (see [Missiles and Torpedoes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Missiles_and_Torpedoes)).

The HH-15 is a [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) weapon with [Penetration](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Penetration) 10 (ignoring the first 10 points of the primary target's DR or SR). It deals full damage to the target if the attack hits its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (half damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and half damage if it misses (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent); adjacent creatures or objects take half damage if the attack hits and no damage if it misses or the target has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent.

A HH-15 Projectile Launcher holds a single missile in its chamber; it must be reloaded after being fired. Replacement missiles cost 100 credits and weigh 2 kg each.
