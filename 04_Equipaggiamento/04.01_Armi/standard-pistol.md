The most common type of slugthrower pistol can fire a wide variety of ammunition types, either by design or with a simple switch of the weapons barrel. Most standard pistols are equipped with adjustable sights and ambidextrous safety levers for the left or right-handed shooters. Standard pistols are excellent close range weapons and are the preferred self-defense weapons of individuals living in low-technology areas. 

A standard pistol requires a magazine to operate. After 10 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
