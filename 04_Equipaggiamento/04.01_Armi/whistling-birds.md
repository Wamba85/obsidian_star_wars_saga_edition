*Whistling Birds weapon data created by Wikia users <bdi>Diogo de Souza and Lukewarner</bdi>.*

A Mandalorian's gadgetry can include many hidden elements to surprise their enemies. On the wrist bracers of their armor, a small [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/flamethrower.md|Flamethrower]] can be concealed as well as a marvel known as "Whistling Birds," a flock of dart-like missiles loaded into the slender recessed sleeve.

As part of an attack, a wielder of Whistling Birds may make a single ranged attack roll. They may then select up to two targets (or a single target twice) to compare their attack roll against, dealing damage as normal. As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), a wielder may instead launch 4 Whistling Birds, using the same method to resolve attacks and damage.

Whistling Birds are contained in units of 18, which are difficult to replace. A single Whistling Bird can be reloaded as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), and replacing the entire set requires 3 minutes of uninterrupted work. Each individual Whistling Bird weighs 0.1 kg, with a full set weighing 1.8 kg.

Whistling Birds are rarely sold as-is, instead needing a trusted forger with a sufficient stock of Beskar. With proper materials, a DC 15 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check and 1 hour of work can be used to manufacture a Whistling Bird. Whistling Birds are treated as [Simple Weapons (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapons_(Ranged)) for the purposes of determining [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).
