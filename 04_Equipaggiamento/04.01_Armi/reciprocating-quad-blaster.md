*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

This monster of a weapon was typically used against slow-moving armored [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) such as the Trade Federation [AAT](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/AAT) or Corporate Alliance [NR-N99 *Persuader*-Class Droid Enforcer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/NR-N99_Persuader-Class_Droid_Enforcer). The rig consists of two double-barreled reciprocating blasters, as well as a large reactor backpack to power the weapon. Both the pack and the weapon itself were fitted with a series of micro-repulsors to reduce the immense weight felt by the trooper. Unfortunately, this made the weapon detectable to repulsorlift sensors. The weapon was field-tested during the Clone Wars by [Clone Commandos](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Commandos), [ARC Troopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/ARC_Troopers), and other elite military units.

Due to the light fusion generator paired with the quad blaster, it has unlimited ammunition. If somehow the micro-repulsors on the unit are damaged and become inoperable, its weight increases to 30 kg and requires the wielder to possess a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 14 or greater to use the weapon, else they incur a -5 penalty to all attack rolls and cannot use any [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats), [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) or special abilities associated with the weapon.
