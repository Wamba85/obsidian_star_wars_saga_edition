*Reference Book:* *[Star Wars Saga Edition Threats of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Threats_of_the_Galaxy)*

A Sonic Stunner creates waves of sonic energy that assault the aural receptors of anyone it targets. The weapon fires a concentrated burst of sonic energy (using technology similar to sonic weapons used by [Geonosians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosians)) that manipulates the minds of living beings, causing them great pain.

Even deaf creatures can be harmed by a Sonic Stunner, because it creates high-frequency vibrations that penetrate the brain. However, unlike with most blaster weapons, only the target of the attack hears any noise, making the weapon otherwise silent.
