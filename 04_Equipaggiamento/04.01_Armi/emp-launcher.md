This bulky weapon was specifically designed to combat the Droid Armies of the Confederacy during the Clone Wars. Often employed by specialized Clone Troopers, the EMP Launcher’s slug would streak toward a cluster of targets and emit an intense electromagnetic pulse, often taking out entire squads of Battle Droids with a successful hit. 

The EMP Launcher was by far one of the most powerful anti-Droid weapon systems in the galaxy. Slugs fired with this weapon have a 2-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. The weapon must be reloaded after two shots, requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). Slugs cost 40 credits each.
