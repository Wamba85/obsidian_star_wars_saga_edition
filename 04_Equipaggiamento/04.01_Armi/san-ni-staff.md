The San-Ni Staff is favored by martial artists throughout the galaxy, including Jedi Weapon Masters looking for more variety than the [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) offers. Consisting of three metal rods held together by power couplings, the San-Ni Staff is a flexible Weapon that can be whipped around the wielder's body in combat, both for leverage and to confuse an opponent. Moreover, a San-Ni Staff's power couplings are made of pure energy that are impervious to [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) damage (much as [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) blades are).

A San-Ni Staff is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).

Additionally, the San-Ni Staff can be used in conjunction with the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** Talent as though it were a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber). Also, the wielder of a San-Ni Staff can designate (at the time the attack is made) that he or she is striking the opponent with the power couplings, dealing [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage instead of normal, lethal damage.

A San-Ni Staff requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate.
