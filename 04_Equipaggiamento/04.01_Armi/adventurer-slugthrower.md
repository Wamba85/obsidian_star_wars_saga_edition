Designed as a long-barreled Slugthrower Rifle, the Czerka Adventurer is used by bounty hunters because of its high accuracy at long-range. Unlike other [Slugthrower Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Slugthrower_Rifles), the Adventurer fills its firing chamber with a rich oxidizer as the bullet fires, propelling it faster to give it a longer range and a higher punch. 

Bounty hunters also prize the Adventurer Slugthrower for its ability to easily break down and be stashed inside a small portable container. An Adventurer Slugthrower can be disassembled or reassembled quickly using a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action). 

Adventurer Slugthrowers don't need [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs); instead, they employ clips that hold 20 slugs apiece. Clips cost 40 credits, and weigh 0.2 kg.
