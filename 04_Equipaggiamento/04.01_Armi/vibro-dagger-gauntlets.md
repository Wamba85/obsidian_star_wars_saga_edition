These are obvious gauntlets, with vibro-blades the size of [Vibrodagger](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrodagger) protruding from it. While not covert, there are useful for both punching things and utility. The blades are capable of both slashing and piercing attacks.

Like [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/combat-gloves.md|Combat Gloves]], Vibro Dagger Gauntlets are two sizes smaller than their wearer (for example, Vibro Dagger Gauntlets designed for a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] are Tiny).

Because of how they are worn, Vibro Dagger Gauntlets can't be [Disarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarmed) or dropped. Additionally, while wearing Vibro Dagger Gauntlets, your [Unarmed Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_Attacks) are considered to be both a normal [Unarmed Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_Attack) (treated as a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee))) as well as an attack with an [Advanced Melee Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapon). Additionally, while worn, treat your hands as if they had [Climbing Claws](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climbing_Claws). Additionally, they provide +1 [unnamed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stacking_Bonuses) Equipment bonus to [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) and allow blocking/parrying/deflecting attacks as if you were holding a melee weapon.

Vibro Dagger Gauntlets require one [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate, which is stored within the casing.
