The Verpine Power Lance is often used while mounted on a speeder bike or animal mount to unseat other mounted attackers or to skewer infantry. The lances were employed by both sides of the Clone Wars by [IG-Series Lancer Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/IG-Series_Lancer_Droids) and [Clone Scout Troopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Scout_Troopers). The Battle of [Muunilinst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Muunilinst) saw the most widespread use of the weapon.

If a Verpine Power Lance is used in conjunction with a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack, on a successful hit, the weapon deals 2d10 damage. If used while the wielder is mounted on an [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount) or [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) moving 10 squares or faster per round, the weapon deals 4d10 damage.

Upon a successful hit with a Verpine Power Lance, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), the attacker can choose to spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to depress the firing stud that activates a secondary damage mode. This damage is determined by what type of tip was previously mounted on the lance, and can do either:
- 2d6 Electrical ([Ion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion)) damage
- 3d8 Energy damage from a blaster bolt
- 4d10 Energy from an explosive charge

This additional damage can only be activated once per tip (with the exception of the blaster bolt tip, which carries 3 charges), at which point the charge is permanently expended. Replacement lance heads cost 200 credits and requires 1d6+2 rounds to reload.

During a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack that results in a Critical Hit, a Medium or smaller target becomes impaled on the lance, immediately moving -2 steps down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), and the target moves with the attacker until they succeed at an opposed [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check with the wielder. The lance's secondary attack cannot be engaged if a target is impaled and no further attacks against the impaled target can be made with the Verpine Power Lance until they are freed.

Each subsequent round that the impaled target fails the [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check, they remain impaled and incur an additional 1d10 damage, and move -1 step further down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). Large or greater targets cannot be impaled. Upon Critical Failure or on an attack roll where the result ties the target’s [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), damage is still dealt, but the tip is considered to have broken and the weapon is unusable for attacks until the lance head is replaced.
