A Disruptor Weapon treats all targets as if their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) was 5 points lower than it is. If damage from the Disruptor Weapon kills or destroys a target, that target is disintegrated and ceases to exist.

Because of the massive energy required to create a Disruptor beam, the Disruptor Weapon can fire only once every other round. You cannot use any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent), or other special ability that consumes more than one shot from the weapon per round (such as [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) with a Disruptor Weapon.
