The Bow is a typical hunter's weapon on low-tech worlds, but it is also used for sport on high-tech planets. A primitive Bow and its arrows are made of wood and augmented with metal or stone, while more advanced versions tend to be made from durable, lightweight composite materials.

The wielder's [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier applies to damage dealt with a Bow. A Bow only holds a single arrow at a time, but can be reloaded as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). A quiver of 10 arrows costs 20 credits, and weighs 0.8 kg.
