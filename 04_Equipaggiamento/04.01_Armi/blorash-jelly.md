*Blorash Jelly equipment data created by wizards forum user Darth_Scorpion.*

Blorash Jelly is an amorphous blob with highly adhesive properties. Any creature struck by a Blorash Jelly becomes stuck, suffering -2 penalties to both their attack rolls and [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). The target must also make a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check against the attacker's ranged attack roll; failure results in the target becoming immobile, success indicates that the target can move at half its normal Speed.

The Blorash Jelly can be removed with a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) check (DC 25) or by dealing 12 points of Slashing or Energy damage (against a [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of 11) against the Blorash Jelly. [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] can manipulate Blorash Jelly by luring it with food, whereas [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) eventually learns that arsensalts can cause the jelly to release its hold.
