A Missile Launcher fires a high-speed projectile with an explosive warhead. The standard missile unleashes metal shrapnel with explosive force, shredding targets within a 2-Square radius.

When you make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with a Missile Launcher, you make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the Weapon's [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Creatures you hit take full damage, and creatures you miss take half damage. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses.

A Missile Launcher holds four missiles, and can be reloaded as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). Replacement missiles are bought in pre-loaded magazines that hold four missiles. Magazines cost 200 credits, and weigh 5 kg.
