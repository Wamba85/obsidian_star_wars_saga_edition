A Handheld Turbolaser Prototype, is one of the first attempts to create turbolaser weapons what can be used by individual soldiers, such weapons are not mass-produced and can be custom-made in small numbers in military [Laboratory](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laboratory), [Turbolaser](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Turbolaser)-producing factories, or made by particularly smart inventors. It is considerably larger than most Weapons intended for use by an individual soldier. It is a devastating Weapon that can wreak havoc on enemies that stay too close to one another. It was designed for use against infantry and other ground-based personnel, yet it is also effective against vehicles and even air targets, as it's range and accuracy rivals most of vehicle weapons.

A Handheld Turbolaser Prototype can be [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced) by spending two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) in the same round immediately before making an attack; if the Weapon is [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), it is treated as a Large Weapon, and can be fired by a Medium character. If the Weapon is not [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), it cannot be fired by any creature of Medium size or smaller. 

Handheld Turbolaser Prototype has three fire modes: single shot, [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire), and charged shot. Switching between modes is [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). In auto-fire and charged modes, it is an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) weapon. It deals full damage to the target if the attack hits its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (half damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and half damage if it misses (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent).

Charged shot has area of effect of 1-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash), and [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) has area of effect of 1-square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst). Any creature or object in the area of effect takes half damage if the attack hits (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and no damage if it misses.

A Handheld Turbolaser Prototype requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) has 100 charges, single shots use 1 charge per attack, [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) and charged shots use 10 charges per attack. After depletion, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
