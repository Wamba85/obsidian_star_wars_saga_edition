*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

The superheavy pistol was designed to fill a niche market consisting of hunting enthusiasts and recreational shooters. The extremely powerful rounds of a superheavy pistol can take down even a raging bantha in just a few shots. The intense recoil and expensive cost of ammunition make the superheavy pistol's usefulness in combat less than optimal. Superheavy pistols cannot be fired more than once per round.

A superheavy pistol requires a magazine to operate. After 6 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
