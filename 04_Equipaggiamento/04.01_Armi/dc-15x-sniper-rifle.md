Perhaps one of the most effective sniper rifles ever developed, the DC-15x is a modification of the [BlasTech DC-15a Blaster Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/BlasTech_DC-15a_Blaster_Rifle). It adds additional optics and range at the expense of power, ammo, and durability. The weapon is used primarily by clone sharpshooters, but also sees use by Republic commando units and ARC troopers.

The DC-15x Sniper Rifle is capable of 5 shots before it needs to be reloaded. The rifle uses [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs). The rifle’s advanced [Targeting Scope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeting_Scope) reduces the [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) modifier by two categories (for example, from Long to Short [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range)), however the weapon is difficult to wield on targets close by, increasing the [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) penalty for Point-Blank targets by one category (from Point-Blank to Short [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range)).
