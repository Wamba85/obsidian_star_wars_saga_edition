Nearly all target pistols feature extended barrel compensators, mountain rails for optical sights, performance triggers and almost always fire high-spec, match-grade ammunition. Though useful in combat, most target pistols require extensive cleaning to maintain optimum performance, and are generally only use for recreational shooting.
