The Double-Bladed Lightsaber consists of two Lightsabers fused at their hilts. These weapons are rare and require even greater skill to wield than single-bladed Lightsabers. One or both blades can be ignited at once.

With both blades ignited, a Double-Bladed Lightsaber is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).

A Double-Bladed Lightsaber requires two special [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate (the cost of each is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).
