Found on primitive planets where Slugthrowers are still used, the Scattergun is a large-barreled, low-velocity Slugthrower that launches a blast of pellets spreading out over a distance. Scattergun and their ammunition are cheap to manufacture and are primarily used for hunting.

However, mercenaries, marines, and other soldiers sometimes carry a Scattergun as a backup weapon for facing enemies in close quarters or for clearing rooms in house-to-house fighting. Scatterguns deal 3d8 points of damage at Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), 2d8 points of damage at Short [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), and no damage at Medium or Long [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).

Scatterguns do not need [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs). Instead, they fire individual shells. Scatterguns hold 10 shells that each cost 2 credits and weigh 0.1 kg.
