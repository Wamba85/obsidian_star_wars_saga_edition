The Darkstick is a curved blade developed by the [Kerestians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerestians). Difficult to master, the weapon is deadly in the hands of a proficient wielder. Although they vary in size, a typical Darkstick is about 20 centimeters long with a handle designed to be gripped between the large knuckles of a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/kerestian.md|Kerestian]]. Masters of the Darkstick can hold two or even three of the blades in each hand, greatly increasing the damage they deal. Darksticks are named for the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/kerestian.md|Kerestian]] belief of the Great Darkness that awaits all souls.

Later versions of the Darkstick also incorporate special webs of light-absorbing cells, which shroud the wielder in darkness. Attacks from enemies who are immediately adjacent treat the wielder as if he or she were in [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment). Creatures or characters with Darkvision ignore this penalty. The Darkstick wielder must be able to see in the dark or take the penalty as well.

Any character proficient in the use of the Darkstick can hold more than one in one hand, as [Kerestians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerestians) do. When wielding multiple Darksticks in one hand, you are considered to be wielding only one weapon, but you increase the damage dice for the Darkstick from 1d6 to 2d8. (This damage remains 2d8 for any number of Darksticks over two.)

A Darkstick can be [Thrown](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown). If your attack exceeds the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) by 5 or more, the Darkstick also returns to your hand immediately after the attack.
