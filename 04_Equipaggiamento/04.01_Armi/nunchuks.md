*Nunchuks weapon data created by Wikia user Admire Lucas.*

Two carbon fiber, plasteel, or wooden sticks, linked together by a chain. A skilled user may wield both ends to strike their foes at once, but using it without proper training can lead to the occasional accident.

Nunchuks are a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty; certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties.

You can choose stop treating the Nunchecks as a Double Weapon to instead increase your [Reach](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reach) by 1 square. If you do not have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/martial-arts-i.md|Martial Arts I]] feat, then doing this provokes [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity) from adjacent enemies.

Additionally, without the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/martial-arts-i.md|Martial Arts I]] feat, if you roll a Natural 1 on an attack roll with this weapon, a damage roll is made against yourself.
