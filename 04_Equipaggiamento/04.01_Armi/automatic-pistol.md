Automatic pistols are equipped with selective fire settings, enabling the weapon to fire single shot or in a fully automatic capacity. Most automatic pistols come with extended barrel compensators for reducing muzzle jump, and some even have a small folding grip for two handed orientation. Though useful for providing suppressive fire, automatic pistol generally eat through all ammunition at an alarming rate and are difficult to control in autofire mode. Only military and law enforcement members are legally allowed to make use of automatic pistols.

A automatic pistol requires a magazine to operate. After 30 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
