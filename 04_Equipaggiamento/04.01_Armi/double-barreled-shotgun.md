The Double-Barreled Shotgun is a close range weapon (using [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) Ranges) that deal significant damage to organics. The Double-Barreled Shotgun normally does 2d6 damage (Piercing), but it deals double damage to unarmored organics.

The Double-Barreled Shotgun can also be loaded with cortosis shot, which can disable [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) blades. The wide-area attack nature of the shotgun gives it a +2 bonus to attacks against [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) blades, and a successful hit shorts out a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) out for 2d6 rounds, and requiring a DC 15 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) to reactivate as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

The Double-Barreled Shotgun itself takes 1d4 points of damage (ignoring its DR; 10 Hit Points total) every time it fires a cortosis shot. Reloading requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). The Double-Barreled Shotgun only holds two rounds, and both can be fired at the same time to add +1 die of damage.
