Little more than a casing attached to a set of finger rings, Vibroknucklers are a Tiny Weapon favored by thugs and petty thieves, mainly because the Weapon can be easily concealed or stored away. The Weapon's nasty surprise- a small microblade that extends slightly beyond the knuckles- is an added bonus.

Like [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/combat-gloves.md|Combat Gloves]], Vibroknucklers are two sizes smaller than their wearer (for example, Vibroknucklers designed for a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] are Tiny).

Because of how they are worn, Vibroknucklers can't be [Disarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarmed) or dropped. Additionally, while wearing Vibroknucklers, your [Unarmed Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_Attacks) are considered to be both a normal [Unarmed Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_Attack) (treated as a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee))) as well as an attack with an [Advanced Melee Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapon).

Vibroknucklers require an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate, which is stored within the casing.
