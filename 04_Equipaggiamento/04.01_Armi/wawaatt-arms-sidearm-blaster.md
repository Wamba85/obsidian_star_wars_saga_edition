*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

This bronzium-plated Blaster Pistol, like most of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/wookiee.md|Wookiee]] arsenal, is used mainly as a home-defense weapon to be operated by females and young ones who have yet to undergo their Hrrtayyk Ceremony. The pistol is nearly a carbine by humanoid standards and powerful enough to discourage most non-[Wookiees](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiees) with a single blast.

Aiming the weapon is notoriously difficult, making hitting long-range targets impossible. During the Clone Wars, these weapons were used as a back-up by many [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/wookiee.md|Wookiee]] warriors who felt the extra firepower might come in handy after seeing the size of the Separatist forces they faced.

The weapon fires 20 shots before needed to be reloaded. It uses a custom ammo clip that costs 80 credits and weighs 0.2 kg. A [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 12 or greater is required to use the weapon, or the wielder incurs a -5 penalty to all attack rolls made with the sidearm.
