The DC-19 Stealth Blaster Carbine is equipped with a sound suppressor for silent operation, and it has an optional mode that uses an expensively refined Tibanna gas mixture that makes a bolt invisible to the regular visual spectrum. This mode comes at a high cost.

The mixture must be reloaded after 10 shots, and the weapon must cool down after each blast to prevent damage to the dampeners. [Shadow Trooper](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Trooper) snipers use the invisible bolts to great effect.

## Homebrew DC-19 Stealth Carbine Data

*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment *

The DC-19 "Stealth" Carbine was designed specifically for use by clone troopers designated Shadow Troopers. The weapon uses a special blend of Tibanna Gas to achieve an invisible blaster bolt without the tell-tale red, green or blue contrail. Painstaking efforts were also made in dampening the noise of the blast. As such, the Shadow Troopers proved able in assassination and other covert duties, allowing some respite for Republic commandos and ARC Troopers. The weapon would later be studied and serve as much of the basis for the [Xerrol Nightstinger](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Xerrol_Nightstinger)- another sniper weapon with an invisible blaster bolt.

Due to the invisibility and nigh-silence of the blaster bolts fired by the DC-19, the -10 penalty when using the [Snipe](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Snipe) feature of the [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) skill is negated. The DC-19 uses a standard [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack), but must be reloaded after 10 shots. However, the Stealth Carbine uses a specialize gas canister (each costing 500 credits, and weighs 0.25 kg) which must be replaced every 500 shots.
