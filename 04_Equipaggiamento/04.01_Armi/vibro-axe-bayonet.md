This is a blade from [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/vibro-axe.md|Vibro-Axe]], meant to be attached to long arms as [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bayonet.md|Bayonet]]-like weapon - and it resembles a axe blade, with form closer to that of bardiche or glaive - but without handle. Instead, the ranged weapon it is attached to is meant to act as handle. It can still do thrusting attacks, but due to blade's shape, they do Slashing damage. It does more damage than standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/vibro-axe.md|Vibro-Axe]] because of added rifle's leverage and bulk.
