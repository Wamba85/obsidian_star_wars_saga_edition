*Black-Powder Rifle weapon data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

An antique on most worlds, the Black-Powder Rifle is rarely regulated. Lacking the capacity and range of most modern alternatives, the Black-Powder Rifle's greatest benefit is the ease in which ammunition can be scrounged together by knowledgeable explorers. However, Black-Powder Rifles are notoriously finicky and require frequent maintenance, else the weapon is prone to fizzling out on its wielder.

A Black-Powder Rifle must be reloaded after each shot and requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to reload, preventing the use of any [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) or [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) that allow multiple shots. Ammunition can be purchased in sets of 50 shots and costs 5 credits per set.

A character [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) can attempt to forage for supplies to make his or her own ammunition, requiring a DC 20 [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check to search the area for the necessary materials. One hour and a DC 15 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check can produce enough ammunition for 5 shots, and an extra 5 shots are produced for every 5 points by which the check result exceeds the DC.
