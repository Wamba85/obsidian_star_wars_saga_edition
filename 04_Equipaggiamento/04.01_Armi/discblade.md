The Discblade, the preferred Weapon of [The Zeison Sha](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Zeison_Sha), is a small metal ring with handles on the top and bottom of the disc and four slender blades that tightly curve back as they extend from the sides. When thrown, the Discblade flies straight due to its aerodynamic design, but a trained Zeison Sha warrior can use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to return the weapon to their hand after it has been thrown.

A Discblade is treated as a [Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown_Weapon) for the purpose of determining [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).
