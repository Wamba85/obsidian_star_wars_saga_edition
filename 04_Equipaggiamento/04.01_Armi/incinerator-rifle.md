Often used by [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/bothan.md|Bothan]] spies to hide the evidence of their misdeeds, the Incinerator Rifle works on the same basic principles as the Disruptor Weapons popularized by [The Tenloss Syndicate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tenloss_Syndicate). Though the Incinerator Rifle is technically no more powerful than a standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-pistol.md|Blaster Pistol]], an Incinerator Rifle dissolves many of the molecular bonds in any target it strikes.

By the time a target is killed or destroyed, the Incinerator Rifle has broken molecular bonds to the point where the target loses all cohesion. As a result, the wielder of an Incinerator Rifle can kill an enemy and dispose of the body all at the same time.

A creature or character killed by an Incinerator Rifle (or a [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), Vehicle, or object destroyed by one) is automatically disintegrated, leaving no trace behind.

An Incinerator Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 20 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
