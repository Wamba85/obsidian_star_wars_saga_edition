A Rotary Blaster Cannon is a [Heavy Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Weapons) that fires a massive spray of blaster bolts at a target. Coming to prominence at the dawn of the Clone Wars, Merr-Sonn's Z-6 Rotary Blaster Cannon is similar to a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/heavy-repeating-blaster.md|Heavy Repeating Blaster]] in many ways. It is carried by a single heavy-weapons specialist, but unlike most [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/heavy-repeating-blaster.md|Heavy Repeating Blasters]], the Z-6 Rotary Blaster Cannon does not require a tripod.

The Weapon is popular among the Clone Troopers of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) because it can be fired from the hip, allowing the wielder to cover a greater fire arc with a single burst. However, the weapon is inaccurate when the wielder does not take time to [Brace](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Brace) it.

If you [Brace](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Brace) a Rotary Blaster Cannon before firing it, you can choose to target a 2x4 square area (instead of the normal 2x2 square area) with your [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) attack. However, if you do not [Brace](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Brace) the Rotary Blaster Cannon, you take a -5 penalty to your attack roll in addition to the normal penalties associated with firing a weapon in [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) mode.

The Rotary Blaster Cannon requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 20 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced. This Weapon can also be attached to a [Power Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Generator) for longer use.
