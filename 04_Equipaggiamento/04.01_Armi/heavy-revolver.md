*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Heavy revolvers are simply larger versions of standard revolvers, firing slugs not unlike those fired from a modern superheavy slugthrower pistol. Some heavy revolvers are even capable of firing rifle ammunition. Most users of heavy revolvers are recreational shooters or ancient firearms enthusiasts. Despite their extremely low ammunition capacity, a few shots from a heavy revolver are usually more than enough to put a dangerous threat down for good. Heavy Revolvers generate tremendous recoil and cannot be fired more than once per round.

A heavy revolver can be reloaded by hand or with a special speed-loading ring (included in the weapons cost). Reloading a revolver by hand requires a full-round action; using a speed-loading ring requires only a move action. Heavy revolvers fires 5 shots before requiring a reload.
