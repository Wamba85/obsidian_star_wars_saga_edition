Sniping rifles are precision marksmanship weapons, capable of accurate fire at extreme ranges. Sniper rifles are typically heavy and are built to higher standards than other types of slugthrower rifles. They use normal rifle ammunition, but fire their slugs with greater kinetic force, causing significantly more damage. They are less effective at close ranges due to the difficulty in bringing the weapon to bear quickly, but excel in -open-field and long distance engagements. Most sniper rifles can also be equipped with suppressors, making them deadly and quiet. Sniper rifles are treated as heavy weapons for the purpose of determining range.

A sniper rifle requires a magazine to operate, After 10 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
