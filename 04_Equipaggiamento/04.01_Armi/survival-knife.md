A small hand-held Weapon with a sturdy blade, the Survival Knife can be used as both a tool and a weapon, making it popular with explorers and survivalists alike. It is frequently issued to pilots in military units in the event they are shot down and survive their Vehicles' destruction. 

The handle is hollowed out to allow storage of very small items, typically rudimentary [Survival Gear](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival_Gear) such as a [Fire Rod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Rod), a short length of binding wire, or an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell). 

A character who has a Survival Knife can always determine which way is north thanks to the built-in digital compass.
