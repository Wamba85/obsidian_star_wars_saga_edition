Machine guns, sometimes known as repeating slugthrowers, are support weapons capable of rapid sustained fir for platoon-sized unit support. They can also be mounted to small armored vehicles or used as emplacement weapons.

Machine guns are equipped with a bipod, enabling them to me braced for firing at specific area targets. Machine guns fired from the shoulder or hip cannot be braced.

A machine gun requires a detachable box magazine or a linked belt of ammunition to operate. Detachable box magazines contain a 200-round belt. Ammunition belts can be joined together to create a nearly bottomless supply of ammunition. Reloading an automatic rifle requires a full-round action.
