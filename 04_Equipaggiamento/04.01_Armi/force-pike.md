Force Pikes are 1-meter-long poles topped with power tips. A two-setting power dial located near the bottom of the pike allows the user to set the weapon to "Lethal" or "[Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun)". Although primarily a Vibro weapon, the Force Pike also delivers an electrical shock through its tip, dealing both piercing and energy damage.

A Force Pike requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
