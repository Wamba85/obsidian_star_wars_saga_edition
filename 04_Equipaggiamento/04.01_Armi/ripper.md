*Reference Book:* *[Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

The Ripper is designed to bypass personal energy shields by dealing physical damage. The Ripper is a pistol that fires a variety of oddly shaped pieces of shrapnel, similar to the [Flechette Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flechette_Launchers) that will be used during the Galactic Civil War. A Ripper's irregularly shaped ammunition penetrates deep into the target's body, damaging it severely.

If a Ripper moves a target at least 1 step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by dealing damage exceeding the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), shrapnel embedded in the target's body immediately deals an additional 1d4 Piercing damage.

A Ripper requires an ammunition clip (20 credits, 0.1 kg). After 10 shots, the clip must be replaced.
