The Elite Beam Weapon fires a composite beam laser able to sweep across a battlefield or focus on one area continually to punch through even the thickest armor over time. It is unique in that it requires no ammunition; instead it inserts needle-like probes into a Geonosian Elite’s arm, drawing out bodily fluids to use as a source of power. While other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) are capable of firing the weapon, they are unable to reload it and are limited to 8 individual [Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks) or 2 [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) bursts.

The beam weapon provides a +1 bonus to all attack rolls made to fire this weapon. Additionally, if an attack is powerful enough to bring a target to 0 Hit Points, the wielder may make an attack on any adjacent target as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). Alternately, the weapon can be used in [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) mode, but in a straight line (4x1-Square) target area.

Each time this weapon is reloaded by the same [Geonosian Elite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosian_Elite), an attack is made against their base [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) (no [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonuses applied). Each time the wielder reloads this weapon without rest and nourishment, the attack roll gains a cumulative +1 attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the wielder moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) until such time they rest for a minimum of one hour and ingest fluids to replenish their bodies. If the wielder reaches the bottom of their condition track, they perish from dehydration.
