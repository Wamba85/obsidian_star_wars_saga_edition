*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Slugthrowers fire metallic bullets – known as slugs – using an explosive reaction to propel the projectiles at a high velocity. While seen as primitive technology by most, slugthrowers are inexpensive, widely adaptable and fire a large variety of ammunition types. Because of the simplicity of their mechanical operation, slugthrowers are often no affected by ion or EMP effects and many can even fire underwater. Slugthrowers can also accept and mount multiple types of attachments, such as laser sighting modules, glowrods, targeting optics, and most notably, sound suppressors.

Slugthrowers are generally easy to operate and maintain, and are able to function in conditions which would destroy the delicate electronics of blaster weaponry. Though slugthrowers require frequent cleaning to maintain optimum performance, they are less prone to critical malfunctions than blaster weaponry. Most slugthrower malfunctions can be easily repaired with a set of simple tools, even in the middle of combat. Another advantage of slugthrowers is the psychological effect of the extreme noise produced during firing. While blasters are generally loud, slugthrowers rely on an explosive reaction to operate, making them far louder than even the largest repeating blaster rifles. The sheer volume of slugthrower fire is a proven intimidation factor in combat.

Despite being technologically inferior to blasters, the introduction of modern construction materials in slugthrower design gives these weapons great durability and reliability. Lightweight metal alloys, ceramics and plastoid parts give modern slugthrowers extended service lives, with some being able to fire tens of thousands of rounds before wear becomes an issue.

Slugthrower ammunition comes in a staggering variety of sizes and loads. Light, low-velocity rounds are useful for firing suppressor-equipped weapons, making them almost completely silent in operation. Heavier rounds can cause massive physical trauma and reduce ballistic over-penetration, while specially-designed armor-piercing rounds can tear through personal body armor and armor plating with ease. Non-lethal rubber rounds are useful for incapacitating a target with minimal damage. Other ammunition types tip the bullets with borless acid, detonite, or even flammable substances which shower the target with flame upon impact.

Slugthrowers are less expensive than blasters and are usually easier to acquire, especially on low-technology worlds. License for slugthrower weapons are rarely difficult to obtain, though certain types of ammunition may not be readily available. While few modern organizations use slugthrowers on a regular basis, they are usually available for special situations. A few large manufacturers such as Czerka, Merr-Sonn, and the Merellian Weapons Conglomerate are notable producers of slugthrower weaponry in modern times.

<big>**[Attachments](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attachments)**</big>

Many varieties of off-the-shelf attachments exist for slugthrower weapons, enhancing the wielder's battlefield capabilities. Some of these attachments can also be used with blaster weapons, though they are not nearly as common. The price of the attachment includes any necessary mounting hardware.

<big>**[Ammunition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Slugthrower_Ammunition)**</big>

Slugthrower ammunition comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and uses. Though most slugthrower ammunition has been standardized over the millennia, occasionally new types of ammo are created to produce various effects. Basic pistol and rifle ammunition is fairly easy to obtain, but specialty ammunition types may not be available, or may be considered illegal depending on local planetary or system laws. Slugthrower ammunition is measured in millimeters, with the number being the diameter of the round. Some weapons can accept multiple sizes of ammunition without needing to change barrels. Other ammunition types may be the same size, but have drastically different bullet lengths, propellant loads or other ballistic characteristics

<big>**[Specialty Ammunition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Slugthrower_Specialty_Ammunition)**</big>

Various types of ammunition exist for slugthrowers. Some types of specialty ammo, such as explosive and pyro ammo are difficult to obtain and may be illegal in many systems. Specialty ammunition is not generally available in belt formats. Specialty ammunition increases the cost of a slugthrower magazine, sometimes substantially, depending on the ammo.
