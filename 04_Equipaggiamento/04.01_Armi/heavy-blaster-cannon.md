A Heavy Blaster Cannon, such as the Merr-Sonn BB-23 Heavy Blaster Cannon used by the [Heavy Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Weapons) specialist in [Joker Squad](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Joker_Squad), is a devastating Weapon that can wreak havoc on enemies that stay too close to one another. Specifically designed for use against infantry and other ground-based personnel, the Heavy Blaster Cannon is considerably larger than most Weapons intended for use by an individual soldier. 

However, a Heavy Blaster Cannon can be [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced) by spending two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) in the same round immediately before making an attack; if the Weapon is [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), it is treated as a Large Weapon, and can be fired by a Medium character. If the Weapon is not [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), it cannot be fired by any creature of Medium size or smaller. 

A Heavy Blaster Cannon is an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) weapon. It deals full damage to the target if the attack hits its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (half damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and half damage if it misses (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent).

Any creature or object in the 1-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius of the target takes half damage if the attack hits (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and no damage if it misses.

A Heavy Blaster Cannon requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 10 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
