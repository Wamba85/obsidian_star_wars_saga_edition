This two-bladed version of the [War Sword](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/War_Sword) allows those proficient in the use of two weapons to take advantage of their skills while wielding only one weapon. Typically the two blades are connected in the middle by a short length of metal, providing a safe place for the wielder to grip the weapon.

A Double-Bladed Sword is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).
