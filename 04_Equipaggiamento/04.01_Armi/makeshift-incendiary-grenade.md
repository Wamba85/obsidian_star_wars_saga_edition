A Makeshift Incendiary Grenade is, essentially, little more than flaming bottle with flammable liquid inside and primitive igniting mechanism (such as flaming rag, or long burning hunting match). These inflammatory weapons detonate in a 2-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius, dealing its initial damage in the round its thrown. Every square in this radius catches on [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) and is filled with [Smoke](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoke), what lingers for 1d4-1 rounds- though, if there are combustibles in the radius, they will also burn until they are extinguished or burn down.

When you make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with an Incendiary Grenade, you make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the Grenade's [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Creatures you hit take full damage, and creatures you miss take half damage. A target with the [**Evasion**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion) Talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses.

While the ownership of such weapons is exclusive to local militias, the simple components of a Makeshift Incendiary Grenade are common to find on even backwater worlds. A less "Makeshift" Incendiary Grenade can be created by more experienced hands; such weapons double the number of rounds [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) and [Smoke](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoke) permeate the area, deals 2d6 [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage, and costs 50 credits. Most militaries however deploy much more advanced versions; such weapons quadruple the number of rounds [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) and [Smoke](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoke) permeate the area, has a 4-square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius, deals 4d6 [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage, and costs 500 credits.
