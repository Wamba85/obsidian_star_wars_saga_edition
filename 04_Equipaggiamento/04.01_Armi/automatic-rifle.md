*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Automatic rifles are military weapons designed for small unit support. They are generally the largest slugthrower rifles carried by troops and are capable of delivering sustained suppressing fire. Automatic rifles are the slugthrower equivalents of light repeating blasters and typically fill the same role in military squads. Most automatic rifles are equipped with bipods, enabling them to me braced for firing at specific area targets. Automatic rifles fired from the shoulder or hip cannot be braced.

An automatic rifle requires a detachable box magazine or a linked belt of ammunition to operate. Detachable box magazines contain a 200-round belt. Ammunition belts can be joined together to create a nearly bottomless supply of ammunition. Reloading an automatic rifle requires a full-round action.
