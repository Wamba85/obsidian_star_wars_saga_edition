*Shield weapon data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

A primitive slab of wood or metal, Shields occasionally see use by credit-strapped militias as a cheap defensive measure against ranged attacks. The easy to replace materials needed makes Shields somewhat useful to these groups as an alternative to [Riot Shields](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Riot_Shields).

A Shield has a [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) score of 5, 15 Hit Points, and a [Break DC](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Break_DC) of 20. When held, a Shield lets you be treated as [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) when [Fighting Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Defensively) (gaining a +5 dodge bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), or a +10 dodge bonus if you choose to make no [Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks)).
