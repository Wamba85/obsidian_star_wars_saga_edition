This Rocket Launcher was first put into service by Republic troops during the Clone Wars. The weapon fires a two-stage rocket-propelled torpedo that is specifically designed to penetrate the ground or walls of a bunker to eliminate the soft targets inside. Once fired, the torpedo slams into the barrier by detonating a series of thermal detonators, burrowing deep into the target structure until it reaches the inside. At that point, a second, more powerful proton charge explodes.

When the weapon is fired, make a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) check for the torpedo with a +30 modifier. If the [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) check fails in beating the structure’s break DC, the torpedo crashes into the structure and detonates, dealing damage to the structure (see [Attack an Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_an_Object)).

On a successful [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) check, the torpedo penetrates the bunker and detonates inside, and the wielder of the weapon makes a single attack roll which is compared to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of all targets within the torpedo’s 6-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius. Targets successfully hit by the blast take full damage, while missed targets take half damage. Targets with the [**Evasion**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion) Talent take half damage on a hit, and no damage on a miss.
