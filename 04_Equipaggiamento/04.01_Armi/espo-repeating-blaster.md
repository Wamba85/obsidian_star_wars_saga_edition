*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

A heavy weapon, similar to the Empire's [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/e-web-repeating-blaster.md|E-Web Repeating Blaster]], this is a heavy repeating blaster. This weapon uses a collapsible tripod mount and a defensive shield. When mounted on a tripod, it is treated as one size smaller for purposes of being wielded (allowing a Medium character to operate it with two hands).

The Espo Repeating Blaster only operates in [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) mode, and requires a [Power Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Generator) to operate. Normally, the Espo Repeating Blaster requires a second crewman to regulate the weapon's [Power Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Generator); this second crewman must spend a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) while adjacent to the weapon to regulate its power.

After you regulate the Espo Repeating Blaster's power, it will function normally until the beginning of your next turn. If the weapon's power is not regulated (that is, if the second crewman has not done so since the same [Initiative Count](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative_Count) on the previous round), apply a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made with the weapon.

Additionally, an Espo Repeating Blaster provides a [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating) of 15 to anyone within a 2x2 square area.
