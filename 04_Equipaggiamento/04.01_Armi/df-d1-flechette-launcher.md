*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

These are portable, shoulder-fired weapons that fire flechette canisters, which release scores of micro-darts in the blast area. They make excellent anti-personnel weapons, as they have the range of a rifle and the effectiveness of grenades; there is also armor-piercing ammunition that can punch through heavy vehicle armor. Flechette canisters have computerized variable range settings; the firer must determine at what distance the flechette canister will explode.

The DF-D1 Flechette Launcher is a slimmed down version of the [FCII Flechette Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/FCII_Flechette_Launcher). With only 2 barrels instead of four, it can be used more practically as a rifle. The Salus was eventually dropped from production due to its inaccuracy at longer ranges.

A DF-D1 Flechette Launcher is an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) weapon. It deals full damage to the target if the attack hits its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (half damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and half damage if it misses (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent).

Any creature or object in the 2-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius of the target takes half damage if the attack hits (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and no damage if it misses.

DF-D1 Flechette Launchers are treated as [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles) for the purposes of determining weapon [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range); penalties for [Ranges](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ranges) beyond Point-Blank are double with a DF-D1 Flechette Launcher. A DF-D1 Flechette Launcher requires special ammunition, with a cluster of six shots costing 600 credits; after six shots, the canister must be replaced as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).
