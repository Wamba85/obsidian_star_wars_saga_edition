A Power Hammer is a Durasteel Bludgeoning Weapon with a small gravity generator located in the head. The user triggers the gravity generator on the downward end of a swing, causing the Power Hammer to hit with more power than the muscles of the wielder can impart to it (though it's difficult for the wielder to swiftly recover from a blow). This results in a weapon that can smash through armored plates or solid rock.

Power Hammer were originally used by asteroid miners. They became popular melee weapons after a few conflicts early in the history of the Empire when mining companies found their possessions claimed by the Empire, and the miners fought back.

Extra damage from the use of the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/power-attack.md|Power Attack]] feat can be added to damage dealt to an object or [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) with a Power Hammer. If you use the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]], [Triple Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Triple_Attack), or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-strike.md|Rapid Strike]] feats with a Power Hammer, you take an additional -2 penalty on attack rolls.

A Power Hammer requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
