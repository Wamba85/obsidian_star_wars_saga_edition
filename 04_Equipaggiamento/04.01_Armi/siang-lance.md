The Siang Lance is one of the few types of technological devices found on [Kilia IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kilia_IV), although only a small number of functional Siang Lances remain. By law, only members of a noble house may use a Siang Lance. In practice, a Siang Lance is given to active members of [The Kilian Rangers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Kilian_Rangers) as a badge of office and to remind themselves and others of one half of their oaths: to defend justice, chivalry, and the people of [Kilia IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kilia_IV).

A Siang Lance is an ancient model of a [Sporting Blaster Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sporting_Blaster_Rifle) with an affixed [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bayonet.md|Bayonet]]. It is typically wielded with one hand, leaving the other hand free to use the Kilian Ranger's [Shield Gauntlet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Gauntlet). A Siang Lance can be used to make [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity). When you would make an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) against a target, you may choose either to fire the Siang Lance as a Ranged Weapon or to use the weapon's [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bayonet.md|Bayonet]] as a Melee Weapon.

A Siang Lance requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 100 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
