*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

Following a joint venture with Merr-Sonn Munitions in its creation of the [EWHB-10 Repeating Blaster](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/EWHB-10_Repeating_Blaster), BlasTech Industries improved on the original design with the EWHB-12. This upgraded model boasts better cooling units and onboard power regulators, requiring power monitoring and regulation from the second crewman as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), rather than a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action). 

It can optionally be equipped with a gunnery chair to provide greater accuracy, which grants a +1 attack bonus (costing an additional 1,000 credits). Some models are even fitted with shield generators that are operated by a separate trooper that provides the gun, generator and its operators with a 10 SR (costing an additional 2,000 credits). 

This turret only operates in [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) mode. Assembly of the weapon can be completed in 2d4 rounds.
