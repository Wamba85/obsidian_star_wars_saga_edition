*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

This archaic weapon was a mainstay with [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/sakiyan.md|Sakiyan]] hunters and enthusiasts. It functions just like a typical [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bow.md|Bow]] but it utilizes a series of pulleys and cams that increase its range and overall force. This weapon uses double the values of the Simple Weapon [Ranges](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ranges).

The wielder's [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier applies to damage dealt with a Pulley Bow. A Pulley Bow only holds a single arrow at a time, but can be reloaded as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). A quiver of 10 arrows costs 20 credits, and weighs 0.8 kg.
