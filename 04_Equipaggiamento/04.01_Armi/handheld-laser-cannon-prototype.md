Handheld Laser Cannon Prototype is early attempt to create personal laser weapons - being about as big as [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-cannon.md|Blaster Cannon]] and [Heavy Blaster Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Blaster_Cannon). Such weapons are step up from conventional blasters due to superior accuracy and range. It turns out what lasers *can* have [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) setting - albeit, not *these large* ones.

Yet another sub-type is result of [backwards civilization](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Industrial_Weapon_Systems) trying to reverse-engineer technologies of advanced races. First step in that research is clunky, usually single-shot anti-tank weapons. The reason is that many pre-space civilizations invent lasers earlier than blasters - so, they have more experience with laser technology.

Handheld Laser Cannon Prototype comes in 2 models: Light and Heavy.

Both models of Handheld Laser Cannon Prototype are [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) weapons. It deals full damage to the target if the attack hits its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (half damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and half damage if it misses (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent). Any creature or object in the 1-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius of the target takes half damage if the attack hits (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and no damage if it misses.

Both Light and Heavy models of Handheld Laser Cannon Prototype can be [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced) by spending two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) in the same round immediately before making an attack; if the Weapon is [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), it is treated as being one Size smaller. 

A Handheld Laser Cannon Prototype requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) made by pre-FTL civilization must be replaced after 1 shot; [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) made with reverse-engineered tech of FTL-era civilization, or made by FTL-era civilization, must be replaced after 10 shots. Light and Heavy model [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack)s are not interchangeable.
