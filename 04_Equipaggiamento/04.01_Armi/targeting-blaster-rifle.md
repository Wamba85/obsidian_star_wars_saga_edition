Although technically a sporting blaster, the Targeting Blaster Rifle generates nearly as much firepower as a military-grade [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-rifle.md|Blaster Rifle]]. Considered a cynical attempt by blaster manufacturers to circumvent restrictions on military-grade [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles), this weapon retains the legal status of a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/sporting-blaster-rifle.md|Sporting Blaster Rifle]] and relies on overfocusing the blaster beam to significantly increase its punch. 

However, to gain the full benefit of the overfocused beam, the shooter must be precise. Targeting Blaster Rifles can be quickly disassembled for ease of storage and just as quickly reassembled when the weapon is needed. Assembling or disassembling the weapon requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). 

Although the weapon is ostensibly designed for the sport hunter who wants something with a bit more kick, the Targeting Blaster Rifle is popular with assassins, and only extensive lobbying by the manufacturers has prevented these weapons from being recategorized as military-grade hardware. 

If you [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) prior to making an attack roll, the Targeting Blaster Rifle's damage dice change from d6s to d8s. A Targeting Blaster Rifle does not have a [Retractable Stock](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Retractable_Stock). A Targeting Blaster Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 50 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
