Anti-Materiel Slugthrower is heavy-duty, large-bore, accurate Slugthrower sniper rifle, designed to kill infantry and destroy small vehicles. 

It doesn't need a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack); instead, it takes clips containing "Slugs," with each clip holding 20 Slugs. Clips cost 200 credits and, weigh 1 kg.

Anti-Material Slugthrower can be loaded with explosive slugs, costing 1.5 times much as normal ones. In that case, it becomes a [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) weapon.

Any creature or object in the 1-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius of the target takes half damage if the attack hits (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and no damage if it misses.
