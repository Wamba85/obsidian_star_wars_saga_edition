*Zenji Needle Equipment data created by Wikia user Darthauthor.*

The Zenji Needle is a thin lacquered needle, roughly the length of a humanoid hand that can be hurled with incredible speed and is capable of piercing through armor when thrown with enough strength.

The Zenji Needle is often disguised as a decoration worn within hair, effectively appearing as apart of her attire rather than a deadly weapon.
