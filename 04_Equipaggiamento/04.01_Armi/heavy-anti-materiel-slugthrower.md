Heavy Anti-Materiel Slughtrower is huge, but accurate Slugthrower sniper rifle, looking more similar to a small cannon than a rifle. It is considerably larger than most weapons intended by use of average soldier.

However, a Heavy Anti-Materiel Slugthrower can be [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced) by spending two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) in the same round immediately before making an attack; if the Weapon is [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), it is treated as a Large Weapon, and can be fired by a Medium character. If the Weapon is not [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), it cannot be fired by any creature of Medium size or smaller.

It doesn't need a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack); instead, it takes clips containing "Slugs," with each clip holding 20 Slugs. Clips cost 300 credits and, weigh 1.5 kg.

Heavy Anti-Material Slugthrower can be loaded with explosive slugs, costing 1.5 times much as normal ones. In that case, it becomes a [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) weapon. It deals full damage to the target if the attack hits its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (half damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and half damage if it misses (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent). Any creature or object in the 1-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius of the target takes half damage if the attack hits (no damage if it has the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** Talent) and no damage if it misses.
