This is a grossly oversized version of [Riot Shield](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Riot_Shield), effectively being a hovering mobile barricade protecting both it's user and his allies.

A Huge Riot Shield has a [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) score of 10, 80 Hit Points, and a [Break DC](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Break_DC) of 32. When held, a Huge Riot Shield grants you [Total Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Cover) against all attacks on any turn, and increases [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) of all allies, standing on the same square as the user or directly near the user, by one step (lack of cover to normal cover, normal cover to improved cover, improved cover to total cover) on any turn during which you [Fight Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fight_Defensively).

The Huge Riot Shield can be used strictly for defense, treating it as Large-sized weapon - but in that case, you can't attack with it.

Due to it's hovering propulsion system, the weight of Huge Riot Shield is effectively being Zero-Friction - meaning it's weight is effectively 1/10 of it's mass.
