*Twin-Linked Lightsaber weapon data created by unknown Wikia user.*

Twin-Linked Lightsaber is a peculiar variant of [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber): it is two normal blades connected to each other in such a way that the "blades" face in the same direction. Jedi Artisans jokingly called it the "Sane Man's [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/double-bladed-lightsaber.md|Double-Bladed Lightsaber]]." More technological and fancy variants have a system reminiscent of the [Lightsaber Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Rifle), which combines power of both sabers into a single beam. Despite it's increased weight, a Twin-Linked Lightsaber is still Medium-sized.

Twin-Linked Lightsabers can be both disconnected and connected back. When disconnected, Twin-Linked Lightsabers function as normal [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/lightsaber-weapon.md|Lightsabers]].
