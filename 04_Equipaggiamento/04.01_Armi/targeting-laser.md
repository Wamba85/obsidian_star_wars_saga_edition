This tiny laser is used to paint targets with a beam of light to guide missiles, bombardment attacks, or other incoming fire, but it otherwise deals no damage. The laser is tunable through a broad spectrum, allowing the attacker to home in on a specific Targeting Laser in the otherwise chaotic jumble of battlefield laser fire.

To use a Targeting Laser, the wielder makes an attack roll, ignoring any Armor bonuses to the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). As long as the wielder repeats the attack each round, any ally who knows the frequency of the Targeting Laser gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls when attacking the target with a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/missile-launcher.md|Missile Launcher]], [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/grenade-launcher.md|Grenade Launcher]], or [Vehicle Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapon).

A Targeting Laser can be used by hand or mounted on any Medium or larger weapon, and requires an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
