*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

The heavy machine gun is a fearsome weapon capable of firing at extreme range with devastating results. Heavy machine guns are too large to carried by individual troops and are usually used as emplacement or vehicle-mounted weapons. A heavy machine gun mounted on a tripod or on a vehicle mount as treated as one size smaller for the purposes of being wielded (allowing a Medium character to operate it with two hands).

A heavy machine gun requires a detachable box magazine or a linked belt of ammunition to operate. Detachable box magazines contain a 200-round belt. Ammunition belts can be joined together to create a nearly bottomless supply of ammunition. Reloading an automatic rifle requires a full-round action.
