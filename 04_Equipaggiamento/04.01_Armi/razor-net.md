*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

Razor-Nets are often used by bounty hunters and slavers as a means of capturing their prey and discouraging escape attempts. It functions the same as a regular [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/net.md|Net]], however, it is more difficult to escape (requiring a DC 20 [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) check) or break out of it (requiring a DC 25 [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) check). 

If the target attempts either of these actions and fails, they immediately take 1d8 damage from the razor-sharp barbs embedded in the Razor-Net.
