*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

This incredibly heavy Disruptor Rifle was created by the [Wookiees](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiees) of [Kashyyyk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyyyk) and used in the defense of their homeworld when the Separatists invaded. The unorthodox ring-shaped grip was common in Kachirho and the southern regions of [Kashyyyk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyyyk). This weapon did not see much in the way of exportation during the Clone Wars due to the physical strength required to wield the weapon properly.

The weapon is powerful enough to punch holes in [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) and reduce Battle Droids to powder. As a Disruptor weapon, the X-1 treats all targets as if their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) was 5 points lower than it actually is. If the damage from the X-1 kills a creature or destroys an object, [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) or [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), the target is disintegrated and ceases to exist.

Because of the massive power requirements needed to create energy streams capable of disrupting matter on the molecular level, the X-1 can only fire once every other round. You cannot use any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) or other special ability that consumes more than one shot in a round (Such as [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) with this weapon.

The X-1 requires a Proprietary Power Pack to operate (Costs 250 credits, weighs 0.5 kg). After 15 shots, the Proprietary Power Pack must be replaced.
