Already decades old by the time the Clone Wars began; the RD-4 Grenade Launcher was adopted by the Droid Armies of the Confederacy. The grenades can be set so that they explode on impact or on a delayed fuse which bounces 1d4 squares (At random) and explodes the following round. Characters with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/angled-throw.md|Angled Throw]] Feat or the [**Ricochet Shot**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ricochet_Shot) Talent can choose which direction the grenade will bounce and attempt to maneuver the grenade around [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover).

When making an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with the RD-4 Grenade Launcher, make a single attack roll and compare the result to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target in the grenade’s 2-Square [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius.

Any target hit by the grenade immediately takes 3d6 damage. Missed targets take half damage. Targets with the [**Evasion**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion) Talent take half damage on a successful hit, and no damage on a miss.

The grenade unleashes Severe [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation) over a 5-Square radius in the following round, and dissipates by one level each subsequent round (e.g. Severe to Moderate, Moderate to Mild, Mild to None). This weapon requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to reload after every shot. Grenades for the RD-4 Grenade Launcher cost 200 credits each, and weigh 0.3 kg.
