A niche weapon used by some Mandalorians during the Clone Wars, the Rope Spike was basically a sharp spike made from beskar fastened onto a rope of varying length. A handful of Mandalorians enjoyed the versatility of the utilitarian weapon.

The simple yet effective weapon could be used in a number of ways:
- As a typical melee weapon.
- A [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/garrote.md|Garrote]].
- As a [Thrown](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown) weapon that can quickly be recovered with a pull of the rope (requires a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action)).
- As a bola (allows [Trip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trip) attacks to be made at range).
Finally, the weapon can be used as a Grappling Hook, granting a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to [Climb](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climb) checks.
