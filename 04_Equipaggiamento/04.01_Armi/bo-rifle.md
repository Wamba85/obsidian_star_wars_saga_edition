*Bo-Rifle weapon data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Bo-Rifles have a long tradition in the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/lasat.md|Lasat]] culture, and were used exclusively by the [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan) High Honor Guard. Since the destruction of [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan) by the Empire, Bo-Rifles are rarely seen anywhere in the galaxy. When a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/lasat.md|Lasat]] is defeated by foe in combat, they would typically relinquish their weapon to the victor.

[Lasats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasats) treat Bo-Rifles as [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles), not [Exotic Weapons (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapons_(Ranged)). Bo-Rifles are treated as [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles) for the purposes of determining weapon [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). Switching weapon modes is a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action).

**Weapon Type:** [Exotic Weapons (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapons_(Ranged))

**Size: **Medium

**Cost:** 5,000

**Weight:** 8 Kilograms

**Availability:** [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare)

### Melee Form
When in Melee Form, the Bo-Rifle greatly resembles an [Electrostaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Electrostaff), with both ends conducting electricity and acting as a Double Weapon.

**Damage:** 2d6/2d6

**[Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) Setting:** YES

**Type:** Bludgeoning and Energy
### Ranged Form
When in Ranged Form, a Bo-Rifle is almost indistinguishable from a typical [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-rifle.md|Blaster Rifle]], only differing in appearance.

**Damage:** 3d8

**[Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) Setting:** YES

**Rate of Fire:** Single-Shot

**Type:** Energy
### Focusing Form
The least commonly used Bo-Rifle Form, as well as arguably the most intriguing, is the Focusing Form. When in Focusing Form, the Bo-Rifle extends like a divining rod, and allows the user to center themselves through [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Only the Force-sensitive could utilize this form, and the already few Force-sensitive [Lasats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasats) where almost completely wiped out in the Imperial invasion of [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan). A character that is not proficient with the Bo-Rifle cannot utilize this Form, even if they posses the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat.

**Special:** While in this Form, wielders gain a +5 bonus on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks made to [Sense Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Force) and [Sense Surroundings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Surroundings). This bonus is only granted to a wielder that is both proficient with the Bo-Rifle, and also possess the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat.
