The Firelance stands out among other [Blaster Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Rifles) solely because of its highly effective [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) setting. When sales to bounty hunters skyrocket, SoroSuub markets the Firelance as "the most effective weapon available for freelance law enforcement officials." Although the Rifle's owners come from different walks of life, most are bounty hunters who use the firearm to bring back their targets alive. 

In addition to its [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) capability, the Firelance is also lighter than other blasters in its class, weighing as little as a carbine and making it a good choice for those law enforcement agents who need to travel long distances to track their quarry. 

A Firelance Blaster Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 50 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
