The Dynamic Hammer by Republic Munitions is intended to be used as a battering ram for breaking down doors, but can be used as a devastating weapon. By using ultrasonic vibration similar to that of a [Vibroblade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibroblade), the Dynamic Hammer pounds a door open by brute force.

When used on physical barriers, a Dynamic Hammer treats the target’s DR against the attack as though it is 5 points lower than normal (see [Attack an Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_an_Object)).
