*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Rotary cannons are multi-barreled weapons capable of extreme rates of fire, usually measured in hundreds or thousands of rounds per minute. The incredible kinetic forces generated by the weapons operation prevent it from being used as a personal weapon by even the largest creatures. Rotary cannons must be mounted on a tripod or vehicle mount to operate, and are treated as one size smaller for the purposes of being wielded (allowing a Medium creature to operate it with two hands). Rotary cannons must be attached to a power generator, wither a stand-along model, or as a part of a vehicle weapon system.

Rotary cannons fire 5 times the normal amount of shots per trigger pull (25 shots when using the Burst Fire feat, and 50 shots when firing in a normal autofire). Rotary cannons cannot be modified to fire single shots.

A rotary cannon requires a belt of ammunition to operate. These normally come in special replaceable drums, containing 1,000 rounds per belt. Some rotary cannon systems incorporate the use of multiple drums for long sustained firing.
