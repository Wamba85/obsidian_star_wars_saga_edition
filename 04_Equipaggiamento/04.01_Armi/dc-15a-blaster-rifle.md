The DC-15a Blaster Rifle was designed by BlasTech specifically to function with the Grand Army of the Republic, and is the largest in the DC series. The rifle was designed specifically to integrate with [Clone Trooper Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Trooper_Armor), to the point of showing the target reticule and ammo count on the HUD of the trooper firing the weapon.

Without this HUD improvement, the weapon is remarkably difficult to aim, both because of its design and length. This was an intentional design mechanic, preventing enemy troops from making use of the powerful weapons.

The DC-15a was as versatile as the troops who utilized it. Standard equipment for the weapon includes a [Tripod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tripod) for increased stability, and an [Targeting Scope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeting_Scope) (Enhanced Low-Light). Due to the integration features, any character wielding this weapon without wearing a functional suit of [Clone Trooper Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Trooper_Armor) suffers a -2 penalty to all attack rolls and cannot use the [Targeting Scope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeting_Scope). 

The DC-15a Blaster Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) and [Gas Canister](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gas_Canister) to operate. After 100 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced. After 500 shots, the [Gas Canister](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gas_Canister) must be replaced.
