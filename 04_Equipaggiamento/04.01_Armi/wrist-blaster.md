For those needing the ultimate in discretion, a Wrist Blaster provides protection without drawing attention. It is popular with [Assassins](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Assassins), diplomats working in hostile territories, and other VIPs who hate being completely unarmed.

The Wrist Blaster is worn as a bracelet and looks like an ordinary piece of jewelry. The bulk of the Wrist Blaster contains the power cell, which is powerful enough to deliver the same damage as a blaster, but contains enough energy for only a single shot.

A Wrist Blaster is meant for use in close quarters. Special alloys mask the Wrist Blaster from sensor scans for Weapons. Detecting a Wrist Blaster with a sensor scan requires a DC 25 [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check.
