Resembling a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/hold-out-blaster-pistol.md|Hold-Out Blaster Pistol]], the Protector PRP-502 Dart Pistol became the weapon of choice for covert operatives and assassins during the final years of the Clone Wars. It grants a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks made to conceal the weapon.

Additionally, the pistol can be broken down into four separate pieces, making it even easier to hide from the prying eyes of customs and law enforcement officials. While disassembled, the Dart Pistol grants a +15 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks made to conceal the weapon, and can be broken down or reassembled as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

The PRP-502 Dart Pistol's maximum range is that of Short [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). A dart carrying [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) delivers the toxin if the PRP-502 successfully deals damage.

A PRP-502 Dart Pistol houses 6 darts, after which it must be reloaded.
