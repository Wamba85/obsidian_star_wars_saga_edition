A rifle version of the notorious [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/verpine-shattergun.md|Verpine Shattergun]], the Verpine Sniper Rifle is among the finest marksman weapons in the galaxy. It creates no sound upon firing, no muzzle flash, and no visible projectile as it fires virtually any object at 1,000 meters per second.

It is favored by high-priced assassins and mercenaries who expect to stay in the field longer than portable munitions are expected to last. This weapon was most famously employed by Sergeant Kal Skirata of the Grand Army of the Republic and his commandos and Null-ARC troopers.

The weapon is equipped with a [Bipod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bipod) and [Rangefinder](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rangefinder) as well as a [Targeting Scope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeting_Scope) capable of visible spectrum, infrared, and ultraviolet viewing. Typical modifications to the weapon allow it to transmit target data to orbital craft for surface bombardment.

In the second year of the Clone Wars, a special, unnoticeable tracking dust was developed to be fired from this weapon to cover a target that would allow them to be located on dedicated tracking sensors from orbit.

Proper ammunition for this weapon costs 1,000 credits for a 50 shot ammo clip (Weighing 0.5 kg). A Verpine Sniper Rifle is treated as a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle) for the purpose of determining [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), and it negates the -10 penalty to [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks when using the [Snipe](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Snipe) Action.

Any item of Fine-size can be used as ammunition fed directly into the barrel after every shot. After firing any makeshift projectiles or when its standard ammunition is reloaded, the weapon requires a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check (DC 25) to fine-tune and takes 1 point of damage (see [Object Statistics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Object_Statistics)).
