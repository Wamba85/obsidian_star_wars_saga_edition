Wrist Mounted Flamethrowers have seen use throughout the galaxy. Primarily used by bounty hunters and Mandalorians (such as Boba Fett and Din Djarin), its effectiveness has been showcased time and time again.

The Wrist Mounted Flamethrower is a ranged weapon that shoots a cone of burning chemicals in a 6-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone). Make a single attack roll and compare it to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target within this area (this is an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack)). A successful attack deals 2d6 points of [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage to the target; if the attack misses, the target takes half damage instead. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses.

Wrist Mounted Flamethrowers are Single-Shot Weapons that must be reloaded after each shot. Reloading it is a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). Replacement chemical cartridges for the Wrist Mounted Flamethrower cost 30 credits each.
