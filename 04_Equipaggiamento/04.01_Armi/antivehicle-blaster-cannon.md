While more portable [Blaster Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Cannon) are designed to be usable both as anti-personnel weapons and for discouraging small [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles), an Antivehicle Blaster Cannon is specialized toward antivehicle use.

An Antivehicle Blaster Cannon has [Penetration](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Penetration) 10, but attacks against targets of Large or smaller size suffer a -10 penalty to their attack rolls.
