Slaver Blade is the colloquial name for a heavy blade similar to the one manufactured by Arakyd Industries often used by [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/togorian.md|Togorian]] and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/trandoshan.md|Trandoshan]] slavers. These durable swords are designed to intimidate when marauding. The weapon is fairly simple in design, although the blade is usually made of durasteel rather than conventional plasteel.

Due to this small change, the weapon is unusually heavy and requires a minimum [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 14 to use in combat. Otherwise the wielder suffers a -5 penalty to all attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and cannot utilize any [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats), [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) or special abilities associated with this weapon.
