The favored weapon of the Emperor's Shadow Guard, the Lightsaber Pike resembles a conventional polearm in many respects. The long haft of the weapon is made of Phrik alloy, meaning that a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) does not ignore the Lightsaber Pike's [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction).

At the end of the handle is a slightly shorter and thicker Lightsaber blade, which can be activated as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) using a switch about midway down the weapon's haft. A Lightsaber Pike increases the wielder's [Reach](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reach) by 1 square, but imposes a -2 penalty on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks to use the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** or **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)** talents.

A character with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/long-haft-strike.md|Long Haft Strike]] feat can use the Lightsaber Pike as a Double Weapon. If you have this Feat, you can attack with both ends of a Lightsaber Pike as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty; certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties. The non-Lightsaber end of the Lightsaber Pike deals 1d6 damage.

A Lightsaber Pike requires a special [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).
