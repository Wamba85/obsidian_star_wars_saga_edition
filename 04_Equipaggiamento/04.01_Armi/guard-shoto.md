A rare variant of the short shoto style of the Lightsaber, the Guard Shoto (also referred to as the Lightsaber Tonfa) has a second handle that sticks out from the main hilt at a 90-degree angle. It is possible to hold a Guard Shoto by either the main hilt, or the second handle. If it is held by the second handle, the lightsaber blade can be held parallel to the forearm, allowing it to easily be used for blocks.

Because a Guard Shoto is designed primarily to block other Lightsabers, it is most useful when its handle is laced with Phrik (a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber)-resistant metallic compound), which can be an expensive process.

A character proficient with the Guard Shoto gains a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks to block melee attacks, or deflect ranged attacks using the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** or **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)** talents. Additionally, [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers) do not ignore the [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) of a Guard Shoto with a Phrik-laced handle.

A Guard Shoto requires a special [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).
