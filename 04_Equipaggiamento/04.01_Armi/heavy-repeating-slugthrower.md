*Heavy Repeating Slugthrower weapon data created by Wikia user DX-2052.*

The Heavy Repeating Slugthrower is a type of slugthrower with an exceptional mass and rate of fire. The heavy weight of its slugs, which it quickly expends, make it unpopular with most forces that can obtain blasters. While primarily only seen only on primitive worlds, some more technologically advanced users swear by the exceptional suppression ability its high level of noise and flash provides.

A Heavy Repeating Slugthrower without a [Flash Suppressor/Silencer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flash_Suppressor/Silencer) may use [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) when [Suppressing an Enemy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Suppressing_an_Enemy). This operates as normal [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire), but instead applies the effects of suppression (-2 penalty on targets' next attack roll) instead of dealing damage. If you use a Heavy Repeating Slugthrower without a tripod or other mount, you cannot [Brace](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Brace) the weapon before making an [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) attack.

A Heavy Repeating Slugthrower doesn't need a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack); instead, it takes belts containing "slugs," with each belt holding 100 slugs. Belts cost 200 credits and weigh 2.8 kg. Multiple belts can be linked together to lengthen the time between reloads, but doing so makes the weapon unwieldy for personal use: a Heavy Repeating Slugthrower takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for each belt attached beyond the first. If it is attached to a fixed mount (like a tripod) or a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), this penalty is negated.

A Heavy Repeating Slugthrower can be attached to a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) (typically a [Groundcar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Groundcar)) by using 1 [Emplacement Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Point); [Double/Quad](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cannon,_Double/Quad) mounted Heavy Repeating Slugthrowers are likewise possible. Since a Heavy Repeating Slugthrower does not need power to operate, it is never considered a [Nonstandard Modification](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonstandard_Modification). When used in [Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale), a Heavy Repeating Slugthrower has the [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) of a [Blaster Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Cannon_(Vehicles)) and gains the [Inaccurate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inaccurate) weapon quality.
