Composite laser weaponry was relatively new during the Clone Wars. An advancement of laser cannon technology, Composite Homing Lasers form a beam that sustained itself for a limited time. This advantage allowed gunners to adjust their aim during a shot, increasing accuracy significantly by providing a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to attack rolls. Also, if the attack is powerful enough to reduce the target to 0 Hit Points, a Composite Homing Laser can make an additional attack as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) against any adjacent target.

Alternatively, Composite Homing Lasers can be used to make [Area Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks) as per [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire), but in a straight line (4-square by 1-square, rather than 2-square by 2-square). The intense power consumption of these lasers requires the use of a [Power Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Generator) to operate. Homing lasers are a variant of composite lasers that can be sustained indefinitely, allowing them to zigzag across the battlefield until they find their target, or bore through thick armor plating.

Composite Homing Lasers function identically to standard composite lasers, but have an alternate firing technique that forgoes the bonus to attack rolls and ability to hit adjacent targets in favor of [Penetration](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Penetration) 5. Switching between settings is a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). Both types of composite lasers use the same range modifiers as [Heavy Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Weapons).
