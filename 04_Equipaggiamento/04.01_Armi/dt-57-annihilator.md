The DT-57 was a rare, super-heavy Blaster Pistol that packed extraordinary power. It was similar to many other large blaster pistols of the day in that it bordered on truly being a carbine in terms of size and stopping power.

The weapon is perhaps most famous for being General Grievous’ sidearm of choice, as well as the weapon used by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to end the Confederate leader’s life.
