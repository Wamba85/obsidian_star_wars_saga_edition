A Variable Blaster Rifle, such as BlasTech's DC-15S, allows a wielder to control the amount of Tibanna Gas is uses, creating more-powerful shots with the potential to deal more damage to the target. During the Clone Wars, when battles are fought far from Republic supply lines, Clone Troopers take advantage of the ability to dial their weapon's power up or down depending on the enemies they face. When fighting [B1-Series Battle Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/B1-Series_Battle_Droids), for example, the clones conserve their ammunition by using lighter damage settings.

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can adjust the weapon's power level up or down. You can adjust the Weapon's base damage to 3d6, but doing so causes the weapon to consume five times more shots per attack. Likewise, you can adjust the Weapon's base damage to 3d8, but doing so causes the Weapon to consume ten times more shots per attack.

For example, attacking with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] feat normally consumes 2 shots from a blaster. On its weakest setting (3d4 damage), each [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] attack with a Variable Blaster Rifle consumes 2 of the Rifle's 500 shots. If the Rifle is set to 3d6 damage, each attack with [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] consumes 10 of the Rifle's 500 shots (2x5# 10). If the Rifle is set to 3d8 damage, each attack with [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] consumes 20 of the Rifle's 500 shots (2x1020).

A Variable Blaster Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 500 shots, the weapon's [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
