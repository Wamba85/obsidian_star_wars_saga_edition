Essentially, an Energy Lance is a [Force Pike](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Pike) that has been combined with an electromagnetic pulse generator (the same kind used by an [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/electrostaff.md|Electrostaff]]) and balanced for use while riding a mount. Energy Lances once were commonly carried by honor guards and ceremonial troops such as the Mon Calamari Knights, and many such Weapons still in circulation bear signs of their once-proud heritage. 

Though an Energy Lance is a Large Weapon, it is balanced in such a way that a Medium creature [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Ride](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ride) skill can wield it in one hand while mounted. If an Energy Lance is wielded by a Medium creature that is not mounted, attacks with the Weapon take a -1 penalty. 

The electromagnetic pulse can also be channeled along the length of the lance and fired from the tip as a bolt of plasma. When used in this way, the Energy Lance functions as a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-carbine.md|Blaster Carbine]] with no [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) Setting. This use of the Energy Lance requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack), and has the same ammunition capacity as a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-carbine.md|Blaster Carbine]].

An Energy Lance requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate. It's melee attack and it's ranged attack both function unimpeded underwater.
