Used in combat and ceremonies by Force-sensitive shamans on [Felucia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Felucia), Skullblades are swordlike melee weapons made from the skulls of local animals. They are similar to crude weapons made by more primitive cultures throughout the galaxy, except for their ability to be imbued with Force energy and (when so imbued) block strikes from [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers).

This is possible because a few creatures on [Felucia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Felucia) naturally grow trace amounts of Force-reactive crystal in their bones. Similar to [Lightsaber Crystals](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Crystals) used for the focusing of Lightsaber blades, these trace amounts aren't large enough to be harvested for any other use, but do make the Skullblades surprisingly effective weapons in the hands of trained Force-sensitive wielders.

Skullblades are considered items of great honor and importance. Although they can occasionally be found on the black market, they are normally available only to those who train with [The Felucian Shamans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Felucian_Shamans).
