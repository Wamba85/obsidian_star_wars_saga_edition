*Homebrew Reference Book: [Dathomir Field Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir_Field_Guide)*

A sinister looking weapon, the Chain Sickle consists of a cylindrical handle from which extended a flexible cord that ended with a razor-sharp, bladed bludgeon. A second grip further up the cord allows the wielder to swing the Chain Sickle with accuracy and force, ending in a bludgeon studded with small spikes. The most lethal section of the weapon is a large scythe-shaped blade covering half of the bludgeon with two protruding smaller blades.

A Chain Sickle is a Melee Weapon with a reach of 2 squares. Also on a hit, you can choose to make a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack (as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action)) against the target using the sickle, provided the target is no more than one size category larger than you. Unlike a normal [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack, you make a second attack roll at the normal attack bonus with the Chain Sickle, and you do not take a -5 penalty on the attack roll. If this second attack roll hits, the target is [Grabbed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grabbed).

If you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/pin.md|Pin]] or [Trip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trip) feats, you can choose to use those abilities instead of making a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack. While [Grabbing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grabbing) a target with the Chain Sickle, you cannot use the Weapon to make attacks against any other targets. Members of [The Witches of Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witches_of_Dathomir) treat the Chain Sickle as a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee)).
