*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

This charged particle submachine gun was commonplace among [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/trandoshan.md|Trandoshan]] slavers and mercenaries during the era of the Clone Wars. It is a fairly unremarkable weapon except that the ammunition fired is more effective against penetrating deflector shields than standard blaster technology.

The ACP Repeater is an [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire)-only weapon and uses the [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) increments of a standard [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle), though it is an [Inaccurate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inaccurate) weapon, making it incapable of firing at long-range targets. With a successful attack against a target protected by shields, the ACP Repeater ignores the first 5 points of an enemy’s [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating).

An ACP Repeater ammo cartridge holds 40 shots and must be replaced once it has been expended. Ammo clips cost 80 credits and weigh 0.5 kg.
