*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

The largest and most devastating model of a slugthrower rifle, the anti-material rifle is a high-precision weapon that fires super-dense, extremely high-velocity slugs capable of destroying lightly armored vehicles, and even fully penetrate most modern building materials. Due to their immense power, some societies consider the use of anti-material rifles against a living person to be unlawful. Anti-material rifles are only issued to military personnel and are considered illegal for civilian use on most worlds.

Anti-material rifles are treated as heavy weapons for the purpose of determining range. The specially-designed rounds fired from an anti-material rifle give the weapon Penetration 5, treating a target's damage reduction as if it were 5 points lower when determining the result of an attack. Sue to the immense kinetic forces generated by its high-velocity slugs, an anti-material rifle can only be fired while the wielder is prone or kneeling.

An anti-material rifle requires a magazine to operate, After 5 shots, the magazine must be replaced.
