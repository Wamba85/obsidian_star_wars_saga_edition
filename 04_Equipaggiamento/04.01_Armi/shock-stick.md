The Shock Stick is a Melee Weapon that delivers a stunning blow to the enemy's senses. Using technology similar to that of a [Stun Baton](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Baton), a Shock Stick has the added benefit of delivering its stunning energy in a rapid, overwhelming bust that can completely disable less hardy beings.

A Shock Stick always deal [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage. When a target susceptible to [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage is hit by a Shock Stick, compare the damage (before halving) to the target's current Hit Point total. If the damage equals or exceeds the target's Hit Point total, the target moves -5 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) and is knocked unconscious. Otherwise, compare the result to the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) and resolve the attack as normal.

A Shock Stick requires an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate. Additionally, a Shock Stick can be mounted on a Weapon as a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bayonet.md|Bayonet]]. When a Shock Stick is mounted on a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle) as a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bayonet.md|Bayonet]], the wielder takes no penalty to attacks with the Shock Stick for not having the [Weapon Proficiency (Advanced Melee Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Advanced_Melee_Weapons)) feat, if the wielder is proficient in the Rifle's use.
