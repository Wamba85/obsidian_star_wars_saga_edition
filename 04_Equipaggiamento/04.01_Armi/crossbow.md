A primitive weapon used by cultures lacking access to blaster or black-powder weaponry, the Crossbow requires more time to reload than a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bow.md|Bow]], and it exchanges [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) for greater stopping power.

In spite of these drawbacks, professional assassins use modified Crossbows because they are quiet and do not show up on [Weapon Detectors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Detectors). As a further benefit to explorers, crossbow bolts can be manufactured by hand with a little time and effort, although the quality of such makeshift ammunition might be questionable.

A Crossbow holds only a single bolt at a time, and it requires a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) to reload. A case of 10 crossbow bolts costs 20 credits and weighs 0.6 kg.
