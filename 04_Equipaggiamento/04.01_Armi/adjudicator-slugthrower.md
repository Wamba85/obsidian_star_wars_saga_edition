The Czerka Adjudicator remains one of the few slugthrower hold-out pistols still in production today. It shares a lot of the same attributes- such as its small size and ease of concealment- with its [Hold-Out Blaster Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hold-Out_Blaster_Pistol) cousins. 

The weapon is popular and useful when slugthrowers are more numerous than blasters. With its limited ammunition capacity and slow reload time, most owners use the Adjudicator as a backup weapon. 

An Adjudicator Slugthrower utilizes ammunition clips of 4 shots each, after which it must be reloaded with a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).
