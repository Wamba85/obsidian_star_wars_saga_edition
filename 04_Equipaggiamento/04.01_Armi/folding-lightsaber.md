*Folding Lightsaber weapon data created by Wikia user TheMightyWagon.*

Identical in almost every way to a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/double-bladed-lightsaber.md|Double-Bladed Lightsaber]], a Folding Lightsaber distinguishes itself by its ability to be folded in half with a central hinge. Although intended simply for convenience, there exists a niche use of the folding mechanism for one proficient in the weapon's use. In the event of a [Saber Lock](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saber_Lock), a Folding Lightsaber grants a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to its wielder's opposed [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check. If the user of the Folding Lightsaber wins the [Saber Lock](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saber_Lock), they may elect to either make an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack or an attack with their [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) against their opponent.

With both blades ignited, a Folding Lightsaber is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).

A Folding Lightsaber requires two special [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate (the cost of each is ten times the price of an ordinary [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell), but it lasts almost indefinitely).
