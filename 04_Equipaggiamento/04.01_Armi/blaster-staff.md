This is an egregious experimental weapon, what looks like [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-rifle.md|Blaster Rifle]] mounted on [Force Pike](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Pike). Limited parties of such weapons were sent for [Stormtroopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtroopers) on [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine) and [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) for testing - it turned out what weapon was notoriously unreliable, impractical and unwieldy, especially in hands of [Stormtroopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtroopers). So impractical, in fact, what **there are no recorded cases of [Stormtroopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtroopers) with Blaster Staffs hitting anyone at all**. It was quickly replaced by regular [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles) and [Advanced Melee Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapons). Though such combination was liked by those who love to bash more than to shoot.

While it's not considered a surplus weapon, due to it's unwieldiness for average soldier, greedy quartermasters try to foist them to other factions instead of "normal" weapons. In cases it doesn't work, blaster staffs either get sent into re-cycling for materials, or get disassembled and re-assembled as parts for makeshift, but functioning "sane man's" [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles) and [Advanced Melee Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapons).

Both it's Pike and Rifle parts can be set to either [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) or Lethal. This weapon is a [Double Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Double_Weapon); you can attack with both 1 rifle attack and 1 pike strike as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties). Each part requires it's own weapon proficiency. Additionally, Pike part of the weapon works as [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bayonet.md|Bayonet]] variant.

A Pike part of the weapon requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate. A Rifle part of the weapon requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 50 shots, the Power Pack must be replaced.

Due to Blaster Staff's horrible balance, it can't be used to [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim), be [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced), have any kind of scopes or other aiming devices, have any kind of stock (including [Retractable Stock](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Retractable_Stock); though it's range chart is still that if a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle)), and also has -2 check penalty to fire.
