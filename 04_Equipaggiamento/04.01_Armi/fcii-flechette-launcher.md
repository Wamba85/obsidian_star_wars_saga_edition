*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

These are portable, shoulder-fired weapons that fire flechette canisters, which release scores of micro-darts in the blast area. They make excellent anti-personnel weapons, as they have the range of a rifle and the effectiveness of grenades; there is also armor-piercing ammunition that can punch through heavy vehicle armor. Flechette canisters have computerized variable range settings; the firer must determine at what distance the flechette canister will explode.

This four-barreled Flechette Launcher can launch both anti-personnel and anti-vehicle flechette canisters. The canisters are launched 6 squares before releasing its razor-sharp micro darts in a 6-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone). An FCII Flechette Launcher requires special ammunition, with a cluster of six shots costing 200 credits (or 300 for anti-vehicle canisters); after six shots, the canister must be replaced as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

Make a single attack roll and compare it to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of every target within this area (this is an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack)). A successful attack deals full damage to the target; if the attack misses, the target takes half damage instead. A target with the **[Evasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evasion)** talent takes half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses.
