The ancient Sect of Kajain'sai'nikto known as the [[03_Regole/03.04_Talenti/morgukai-warrior-talent-tree.md|Morgukai]] were the original creators of the Cortosis Staff- a weapon they wielded against [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) mercilessly. The weapon consists of a long staff made from cortosis ore, which is capable of parrying a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) blade. An energy spearhead enveloped in a plasma sheath is fixed to one end of the shaft. Morgukai Cortosis staves are coveted by collectors, as they are exceedingly difficult to locate and acquire.

A Cortosis Staff is a Double Weapon. You can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties). Additionally, a Cortosis Staff retains its DR against [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) attacks.

Cortosis Staffs use the [Cortosis Weave General Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cortosis_Weave_General_Template), retaining their DR against [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers). A Cortosis Staff requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
