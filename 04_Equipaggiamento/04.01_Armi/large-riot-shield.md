This is a larger version of [Riot Shield](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Riot_Shield), nearly completely covering an entire person.

A Large Riot Shield has a [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) score of 5, 40 Hit Points, and a [Break DC](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Break_DC) of 25. When held, a Large Riot Shield grants you [Improved Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Improved_Cover) (+10 [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense)) against all attacks on any turn during which you [Fight Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fight_Defensively).

The Large Riot Shield can be used strictly for defense, treating it as Medium-sized weapon - but in that case, you can't attack with it.

Large Riot Shield can be put on wheels for no extra cost - making it's effective weight 1/5th of it's mass - but, unless user lifts the Large Riot Shield off the ground (nullifying the weight reduction), he is unable to [Climb](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climb), and penalties for [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) are doubled. Alternatively, for extra 500CR, user can install hovering system to the shield, making it's weight 1/10th of it's mass, and nullifying the problems with passability.
