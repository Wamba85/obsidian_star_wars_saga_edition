*ARC Caster weapon created by Wikia user Jayjaxx123.*

The ARC Caster is a modified [E-11 Blaster Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Rifle) that when fired unleashes powerful electrical bolts, capable of destroying electronics and organics alike. They were used by both [Phase 0](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Phase_0_Dark_Trooper) and [Phase II](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Phase_II_Dark_Trooper) Dark Troopers, as well as by [Imperial Royal Guards](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Royal_Guards). 

The ARC Caster can be charged as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) or [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), allowing its electrical bolt to arc between multiple nearby targets. The weapon remains charged until fired and can only be discharged by firing. For every full minute it remains charged without firing, it moves -1 step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

When a target is hit by an ARC Caster charged with a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), in addition to the normal effects, determine a random target within 2 squares. That target suffers half damage if the attack exceeds its [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). If the ARC Caster was charged as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), this process is repeated, even if the secondary target took no damage, jumping another 2 squares to a random target. The ARC Caster's wielder can never be a secondary or tertiary target of the arc, nor can any target be struck twice by the same arc. 

ARC Casters are treated as [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles) for the purposes of determining weapon [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). An ARC Caster requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 5 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced. You may not use any ability that consumes more than one shot (such as [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) in conjunction with an ARC Caster.
