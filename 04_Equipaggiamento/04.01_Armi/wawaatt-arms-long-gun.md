The Long-Gun was a devastating weapon that, despite its name, was designed for short-range combat. The weapon was best known for its incredible stopping power, but also had a reputation for its poor accuracy and low ammo count.

The staggering weight and recoil of the gun limited its use to individuals of prodigious strength, the most famous of which was Tarfful of [Kashyyyk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyyyk) during the Confederate invasion of Kachirho.

The weapon fires 10 shots before needed to be reloaded. It uses a custom ammo clip that costs 150 credits and weighs 0.5 kg. A [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 14 or greater is required to use the weapon or the wielder incurs a -5 penalty to all attack rolls made with the Long-Gun.
