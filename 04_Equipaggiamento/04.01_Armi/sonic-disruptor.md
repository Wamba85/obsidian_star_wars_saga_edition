*Reference Book:* *[Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

One of the most violent [Sonic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic) weapons on the market, the Sonic Disruptor is outlawed by the Republic, even for use against the Sith. The Sonic Disruptor not only deals devastating [Sonic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic) damage to a target, it also atomizes anything it harms, leaving few traces of a victim behind.

Like all weapons that deal [Sonic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic) damage, a Sonic Disruptor's attacks cannot be negated using the **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)** Talent (or any [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) with **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)** as a prerequisite).

As a Disruptor Weapon, the Sonic Disruptor treats all targets as if their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) was 5 points lower than it is. If damage from the Sonic Disruptor kills or destroys a target, that target is disintegrated and ceases to exist.

Because of the massive energy required to create a Disruptor beam, the Sonic Disruptor can fire only once every other round. You cannot use any [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent), or other special ability that consumes more than one shot from the weapon per round (such as [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) with a Sonic Disruptor.

A Sonic Disruptor requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack). After 10 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be recharged.
