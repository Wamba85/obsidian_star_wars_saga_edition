*Vibroarbir Blade weapon data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

One pair of Snoke's Praetorian Guards wields twin Vibroarbir Blades that can be joined at the ends to form a single double-bladed polearm or wielded independently in each hand. The blades' metal edges are complemented by razor-sharp beams of electro-plasma.

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can combine two Vibroarbir Blades, at which point they become a Double Weapon statistically equivalent to a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/double-vibroblade.md|Double Vibroblade]]. After doing so, you can attack with both ends of the weapon as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), but both attack rolls take a -10 penalty (although certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) and [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) can reduce these penalties).

A Vibroarbir Blade requires an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
