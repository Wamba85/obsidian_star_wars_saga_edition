Designed by Golan Arms under exclusive contract with the Galactic Republic, and then the Empire, the CR-1 Blast Cannon fires a burst of blaster bolts, each at reduced power, that spread out in an ever-expanding wave of energy. Often used to suppress riots or eliminate threats gathered in large crowds, the CR-1 Blast Cannon can be incredibly lethal at Short and Medium [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), but becomes ineffective at Long [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).

The CR-1 Blast Cannon is treated as a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) for the purposes of determining the weapon's [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). However, the CR-1 Blast Cannon does not take Range Penalties to attack rolls, instead applying any Range Penalties to damage rolls.

Against adjacent targets, the CR-1 Blast Cannon deals an additional 1d8 points of damage. Against nonadjacent targets, the CR-1 Blast Cannon acts as a [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) Weapon with a 1-Square [Splash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Splash) radius.

A CR-1 Blast Cannon requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 10 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
