This small sidearm was issued to clone commandos as a last resort weapon. The pistol is underpowered and short-ranged, but the self-charging battery provides unlimited ammunition, making it a great survival tool in the dire situations in which commandos are often placed.

The pistol recharges 1 shot every 2 rounds. Like all weapons in its series, the DC-15s design is integrated into the heads-up display of [Clone Trooper Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Trooper_Armor).
