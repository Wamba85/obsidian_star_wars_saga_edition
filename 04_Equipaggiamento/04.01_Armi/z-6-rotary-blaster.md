This massive Rotary Blaster saw limited use during the Clone Wars. The incredibly heavy design and poor accuracy meant the weapon wasn’t practical for most field applications. Despite its diminished usefulness, there were several occasions, such as Yoda’s mission to [Rugosa](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rugosa) or the rescue at [Hypori](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hypori), where it was used with distinction. The rotary design allow for an incredible 166 shots fired per second. The weapon was fed by a chain of [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs) that the repeater chewed through, earning it the nickname of "Chain Gun." 

Due to its size and weight, the Z-6 Rotary Blaster incurs a -5 penalty to all attack rolls and cannot be [Braced](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Braced) when it is fired without the use of a [Bipod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bipod) or [Tripod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tripod) if the wielder does not possess a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score of 14 or higher. Each [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) contains enough energy for a single [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) burst. Typically, a [Bandolier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bandolier) is used to carry 12 [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs), but chains of [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs) can be continually fed into the weapon to provide as much ammo as is needed (via belt pouch or backpack). Alternately, a [Power Generator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Generator) can be used to allow unlimited ammunition.
