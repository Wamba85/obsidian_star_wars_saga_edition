Designed to help [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/squib.md|Squib]] salvagers penetrate the inner parts of derelict Starships, the Squib Battering Ram allows the wielders to punch through doors with greater efficiency.

A Battering Ram requires two characters to operate (one to stabilize the Squib Battering Ram, and one to trigger its activation). The weapon is too unwieldy to be used against a living, moving target, but it deals normal damage to stationary, unattended objects (such as walls or doors).

A Battering Ram requires four [Power Packs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Packs) to operate.
