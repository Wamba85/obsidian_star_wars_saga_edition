*Homebrew Reference Book: [Smoking Guns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smoking_Guns)*

Shotguns, commonly known as “scatter guns”, “shot rifles”, or “boom sticks”, are close quarters weapons capable of inflicting immense damage. Shotguns are especially intimidating weapons, as the spread of their rounds can damage targets adjacent to the impact point, making them very effective in room-clearing situations. Shotguns are usually pump-action or recoil-operated weapons.

Shotguns have the same range as pistols, but do not take penalties to attack rolls. Instead apply range penalties to damage. Additionally, shotguns function as splash weapons against adjacent targets (1 square splash).

A shotgun fires from an integrated tubular magazine that can either be reloaded by hand or with a special reloading tube (usually included with the cost of the weapon). Reloading a shotgun by hand requires a full round action; using a reloading tube only requires a move action. Shotguns fire 8 shots before requiring a reload.
