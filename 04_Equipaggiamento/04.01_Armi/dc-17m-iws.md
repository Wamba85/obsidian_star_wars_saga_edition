*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Equipment*

BlasTech Industries made several extraordinarily reliable and versatile weapons for the Grand Army of the Republic, but perhaps the most impressive example of their ingenuity was the DC-17m. Usually reserved for use by commando units, the DC-17m, or Deecee, as it was often called, had the ability to swap out four different attachments to augment its use in the field.

A standard [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-rifle.md|Blaster Rifle]] came attached to the base unit, but Anti-Armor, Long-Range, and pulsed energy projectile attachments were also made to fit the weapon. Republic commandos swore by the weapon’s capabilities and rarely found a need for other weapons.

The DC-17m was fully integrated into the clone [*Katarn*-Class Commando Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Katarn-Class_Commando_Armor), providing an ammo count and targeting reticule in the armor’s heads-up display. Switching between attachments requires two Full-Round Actions.

### PEP Laser
The Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) Laser attachment was newly developed for the DC-17m after the first year of the Clone Wars. Its design allows it to fire non-lethal, plastoid-encased projectiles that break apart, unleashing the fluoride laser pulse contained within that disrupts the nervous system of organic targets, causing temporary paralysis.

The PEP Laser uses a specialized ammo cartridge contained within the attachment capable of 15 shots before it requires reloading (costing 100 credits, each weighing 0.5 kg).
