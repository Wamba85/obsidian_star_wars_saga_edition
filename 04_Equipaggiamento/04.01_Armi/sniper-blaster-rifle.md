A favorite among assassins and military sharpshooters, the Sniper Blaster Rifle is a powerful and accurate Weapon ideal for eliminating targets at Long [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). Unwieldy in anything other than a prepared firing position, the Sniper Blaster Rifle is poorly suited for use in close combat.

If you do not [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) at your target immediately before making an attack with a Sniper Blaster Rifle, you take a -5 penalty on your attack roll. Sniper Blaster Rifles often have a [Bipod](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bipod) and [Targeting Scope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeting_Scope) mounted on them, but neither is included in the cost listed. A Sniper Blaster Rifle cannot benefit from the [Rapid Recycler](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rapid_Recycler) Weapon Upgrade.

A Sniper Blaster Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 10 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
