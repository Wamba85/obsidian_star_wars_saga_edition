The Repeating Crossbow is popular with collectors and historical aficionados as well as with hunters who desire an additional challenge. The Dolan Plasteel Repeating Crossbow is a typical example of this weapon. Made from lightweight Plasteel, it has a large under-slung magazine of quarrels.

With each shot, the next quarrel is brought up while the string automatically recocks, allowing the Crossbow to be fired every round. The Repeating Crossbow magazine holds 10 quarrels, costs 30 credits and weighs 1.2 kg. A magazine can be replaced as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).
