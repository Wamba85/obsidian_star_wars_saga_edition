Sporting Blaster Rifles are popular with the galactic elites as well as among "Fringers" living in isolated colonies. Sporting Blaster Rifles are legal in most systems, but special permits must be obtained to carry them on many [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds). Luke Skywalker kept a Sporting Blaster Rifle in his landspeeder on [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine).

Sporting Blaster Rifles often have a [Targeting Scope](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeting_Scope) mounted on them, but the scope is not included in the cost listed. A Sporting Blaster Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 100 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be replaced.
