A Bryar Rifle is a large [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/blaster-rifle.md|Blaster Rifle]] with a heftier firing chamber than on standard designs. Heavy and less accurate than most [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles), the Bryar Rifle makes up for its shortcomings by being able to charge up an overpowered blaster shot, allowing it to hit with much more power than typical weapons its size.

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can prime a Bryar Rifle for a built-up shot. If you make no attacks with the Bryar Rifle before the start of your next turn, the next attack you make before the end of the encounter deals +1 die of damage and consumes 5 charges. You may not use any ability that consumes more than one shot (such as [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]) in conjunction with a primed shot.

A Bryar Rifle requires a [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) to operate. After 50 shots, the [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) must be recharged.
