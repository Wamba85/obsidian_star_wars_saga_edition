The Stokhli Spray Stick is a hunting weapon designed to bring down a target without killing it. The Stokhli Spray Stick is one of the few long-range [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) weapons in the galaxy, and high demand for the weapon has driven its price up to match. The Stokhli Spray Stick fires a fine mist that coalesces into the form of a sticky webbing that wraps up its target as a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/net.md|Net]] does.

When the Stokhli Spray Stick's webbing strikes a target, it also discharges a stun bolt that can render some of the toughest targets unconscious. Any target struck by a Stokhli Spray Stick takes 3d8 points of [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage; additionally, the Stokhli Spray Stick's webbing functions as a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/net.md|Net]], allowing the attacker to initiate a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) or [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) on the target at range.

A Stokhli Spray Stick requires canisters of spraymist to operate. After 80 shots, the canister must be replaced, and each canister costs 100 credits.
