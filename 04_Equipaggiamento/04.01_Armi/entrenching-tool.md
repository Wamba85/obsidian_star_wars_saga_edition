Used by soldiers for thousands of years, the Entrenching Tool is a durable, multipurpose tool that also can be an effective melee weapon. The Entrenching Tool can be configured as a short shovel, a pickaxe, or even a makeshift hammer.

The Entrenching Tool is designed to be durable enough for combat, but it is not as balanced as a regular Weapon. The wielder takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls ([Improvised Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Improvised_Weapons) normally impose a -5 penalty to attack rolls) and can choose to deal either Piercing or Slashing damage.
