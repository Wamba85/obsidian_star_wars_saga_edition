Power Lances function as [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/energy-lance.md|Energy Lances]] that lack the ability to fire bolts of plasma. These Weapons are significantly cheaper and are mass-produced as secondary Weapons for scouts on [Speeder Bikes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speeder_Bikes) and for cavalry.

Though a Power Lance is a Large Weapon, it is balanced in such a way that a Medium creature [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Ride](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ride) skill can wield it in one hand while mounted. If a Power Lance is wielded by a Medium creature that is not mounted, attacks with the Weapon take a -1 penalty.

A Power Lance requires two [Energy Cells](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cells) to operate.
