Typically fashioned from a strand of spun Durasteel, a Garrote is designed to crush the target's throat and prevent breathing. A Garrote requires two hands to use, and any attack made with the Garrote is treated as a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack.

Bonuses granted by [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) and [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) apply to the [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attack as though it was a Garrote attack; for example, a character with the [Weapon Focus (Garrote)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Garrote)) feat gains a +1 bonus on [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) attacks made with the Garrote.

The effects of a Garrote are felt on the target's turn. At the beginning of the [Grabbed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grabbed) target's turn, before it can take any [Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Actions), the target takes damage from the Garrote and moves -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). The target also suffers the normal effects of a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab). The target may attempt to break the [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab), as normal.
