The Tehk'la Blade is a handheld weapon in common use throughout [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/nagai.md|Nagai]] society. Similar in design to [Vibrodaggers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrodaggers), Tehk'la Blades are fashioned individually for, and often by, the owner of the weapon. The leading edge of a Tehk'la Blade is serrated, and vibration inducers cause it to oscillate at several thousand cycles per minute, enhancing its cutting power.

The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/nagai.md|Nagai]] fighting style that employs Tehk'la Blades relies on wounding an enemy, whittling him down until their lack of effectiveness permits a killing blow. The blades are designed to tear and rend as they are withdrawn from stab wounds, making them particularly fearsome in the hands of a trained combatant.

If the attack roll made by the wielder of a Tehk'la Blade equals or exceeds both the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage from bleeding at the start of its next turn.

[[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/nagai.md|Nagai]] treat Tehk'la Blades as [Simple Weapons (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapons_(Melee)) instead of as [Exotic Weapons (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapons_(Melee)).

A Tehk'la Blade requires an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) to operate.
