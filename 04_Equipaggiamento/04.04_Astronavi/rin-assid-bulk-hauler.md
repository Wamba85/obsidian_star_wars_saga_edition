*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

Most of the fame in space hauling goes to the small-time operators; they may not be respectable, but they are legendary. Still, there is something to be said for those souls who pilot huge bulk cargo vessels. The job may not be glamorous, heroic, or risky, but the galaxy would grind to a halt if not for the people who keep these lumbering titans on the move.

While there are countless makes and models of bulk cargo ships, a few have stood the test of time. One of these is the Rin Assid Bulk Hauler.

Rin Assid was a famous, almost mythical trader who lived during the Republic's fourth millennium. Called "Assid the Lucky," he was a jovial and good-natured fellow, and very fond of food and drink. He made and lost fortunes as readily as others changed clothing. When he did go broke it was because he used his wealth to help those in need.

The ships themselves are little more than large cargo holds strapped to engines and a crew and passenger compartment. Nonetheless, the ships are sturdy, dependable, and have a certain charm all their own. The design has been around, in one variation or another, for over seven centuries, making the ship almost as enduring as its namesake.
