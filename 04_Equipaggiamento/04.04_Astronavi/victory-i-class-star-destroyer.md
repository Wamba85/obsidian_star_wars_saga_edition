*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

The *Victory I*-Class Star Destroyer was designed during the Clone Wars by Walex Blissex as part of the Victor Initiative Project, aimed at producing dedicated warships to directly oppose the heavy warships of the Separatists. At the time of its first production, there was serious doubt about the Republic's ability to defeat the Separatists, and as a result a crash building program churned out a large number of *Victory*-Class ships. Though successful enough in fleet engagements, the ships turned out to be painfully slow, and they depended heavily on missile munitions (Preventing them from engaging in long running battles). By the end of the Clone Wars, superior ships were already in production.

However, since so many *Victory I*-Class Star Destroyers were in existence, they became the backbone of Imperial power for the first decades of the New Order. Though [*Imperial I*-Class Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyers) were larger and more powerful, *Victory I*-Class ships were far more common. Small, unorganized bands of pirates or insurgents rarely required more than a *Victory*-Class ship (Often with a few [Imperial Customs Corvettes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Customs_Corvettes) as escorts). In later years, enough other classes of ships had been built that the aging *Victory*-Class vessels were no longer as common. Many were sold to private concerns, including several hundred to [The Corporate Sector Authority](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Corporate_Sector_Authority).

Variants of the *Victory*-Class were common. Though the standard model carries twenty massive assault concussion missile tubes (For planetary assaults). many replaced those with eighty standard [Concussion Missile Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion_Missile_Launchers) (With a total payload of 1,600 missiles). A later upgrade, the [*Victory II*-Class Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_II-Class_Star_Destroyer), had improved engines installed for a higher speed. These became much more commonplace after the fall of the Emperor, and created a new era for the decades-old ships.

### Tactical Fire
Imperial Star Destroyers are designed to provide heavy gunnery support in any situation, and excel at disrupting other [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) above all. Their weakness against other ships, such as [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters), is usually overcome by their own complement of [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters). As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Victory I*-Class Star Destroyer can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 2-square radius. All allied Starships attacking targets within this area gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls.
