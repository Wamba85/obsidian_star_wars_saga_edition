*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

Commander Merai was considered to be a great hero of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/quarren.md|Quarren]] conflict that preceded the Clone Wars on [Mon Calamari](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mon_Calamari_(Planet)), and was regarded as one of the greatest [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/mon-calamari.md|Mon Calamari]] tacticians of his day. Merai was convinced by his cousin to joined the Separatists, and brought a loyal fleet and [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) corps with him, including his personal fighter; The *Shark*. The *Shark* was used to participate in the assault on [Kamino](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kamino), where Merai personally attempted to take out the shield generator for the cloning facilities.

While Merai and his *Shark* performed remarkably against a flight of Jedi *Aethersprite* Interceptors, he soon realized he had been set-up to fail, and ordered a retreat. In his final act, he set The *Shark* to self-destruct and crashed it into the [Booster Rings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Booster_Rings) of the Jedi Starfighters, sacrificing his ship and his life. His death made certain [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) could not track his fleet, ensuring his brothers in arms would live to fight another day.

### Capabilities
The *Shark* began life as a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/kantrey-class-amphibious-starfighter.md|*Kantrey*-Class Amphibious Starfighter]], but was modified drastically to maximize its capabilities and suit the commander's battle prowess. The ship was upgraded in nearly every category and given a much more versatile arms load-out, allowing Merai to achieve nearly any objective in any theater of combat by himself. Merai was known as a capable, if reckless, pilot and he needed a durable ship for those times when he felt the need to contribute to the battle personally.

Merai had the sensor blisters replaced with an upgraded package, and mounted two [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons) and an [Ion Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ion_Cannon) on the main fuselage. This allowed him to remove the wing-like weapon mounts to reduce his target profile and reduce his drag, particularly while submerged. He also had the engines replaced with a larger, more powerful model. The hull was moderately upgraded, including significant additional armor over the cockpit, relying on sensors and monitors for vision instead of a clear cockpit. While this does provide a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) checks to [Use Sensors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Sensors), it imposes a -2 penalty to [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks. This ship also has the [Delicate Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Delicate_Systems) Vulnerability.
