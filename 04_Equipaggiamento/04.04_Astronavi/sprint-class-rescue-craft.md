*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

SoroSuub created the *Sprint*-Class Rescue Craft as a rapid-response emergency vehicle. Med Runners, as they came to be known, saw heavy use during the Clone Wars, working in conjunction with [*MedStar*-Class Frigates](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/MedStar-Class_Frigates). These rescue craft would sweep the carnage of the battlefield searching for survivors stranded in the wreckage and could bring them aboard and provide medical assistance.

In the aftermath of the Battle of [Boz Pity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Boz_Pity) in the thirty-first month of the Clone Wars, Med Runners were used to ferry the wounded from the battlefield to [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) and other nearby medical centers. One of the Med Runners assigned to [Boz Pity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Boz_Pity), *Bright Flight*, was hijacked by Asajj Ventress and she used it to flee to [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions) to hide from Dooku as well as the Republic.

### Capabilities
*Sprint*-Class Rescue Crafts are outfitted with sophisticated military-grade sensors used to perform deep sensor sweeps for life forms. Its high-powered engines and maneuvering thrusters allow it to navigate the chaotic debris fields left after space battles to search for survivors. Many of the amenities afforded to even basic passenger quarters such as sound baffles and partial inertial dampeners have been stripped to allow for additional beds in the medical bay.

This provides for an uncomfortable ride (Crew often referred to these ships as "Howlrunners" because the interior was extremely noisy), but every minute counts when saving lives. What little cargo space this craft has is dedicated to storing medical supplies and rescue equipment such as cutting torches and breathing apparatus. The ship is also equipped with four bacta tanks for critical patients.
