*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

The *Carrack* was designed during the waning years of the Republic as a less expensive alternative to other [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships). Because of its speed and agility when compared to other Clone Wars-era [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships), the *Carrack* was used as a fast-attack escort for larger vessels. The design also saw heavy use as an armed escort for merchant convoys, which were continuously targeted by Separatist forces. A group of *Carracks* assisted in the destruction of the Separatist flagship *Invisible Hand* during the Battle of [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant).

After the introduction of larger and more powerful [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships), groups of *Carracks* were more often utilized as scouts and skirmishers for larger fleet elements. In addition, the *Carrack* was popularly used as a personal transport for Imperial officers and political dignitaries throughout the rise of the Empire.

### Capabilities
The *Carrack* is heavily armed for its size. Given the amount of weaponry that a *Carrack* can bring to bear on a target, it poses a significant threat, even to larger enemy vessels. When employed in small squadrons, *Carracks* can wreak havoc on Starships ten times their size.

One reason that *Carrack* crews are so fond of their vessels is that the ship is a sturdy design that incorporates redundant internal bracing and compartmentalized bulkheads. Crew survivability ratings for destroyed and damaged *Carracks* are some of the highest on record. Because of the internal schematics of the *Carrack*, it has no significant internal hangar space. Instead, the *Carrack* is equipped with external racks that can transport up to four [TIE Fighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/TIE_Fighters).

### Tactical Fire
The *Carrack*-Class Light Cruiser is a heavily armed vessel that packs quite a punch, and can often combine fire with other vessels easily. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Carrack*-Class Light Cruiser can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all adjacent squares. All allied Starships attacking targets within that area deal +1 die of damage on a successful attack.
