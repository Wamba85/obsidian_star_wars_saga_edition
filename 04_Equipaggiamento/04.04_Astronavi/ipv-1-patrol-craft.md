The IPV-1 is a typical system patrol craft, a Starship designed to guard a single star system. Built by Sienar, the IPV-1 Patrol Craft was originally designated the Independent Patrol Vehicle to represent its primary mission- operating independently in antipirate and antismuggling activities. After the rise of the Empire, it was designated the Imperial Patrol Vehicle, though little else changed. Ships of this type are also often called monitors or system frigates.

Since a system with a serious problem is likely to have larger and more powerful fleets assigned to it, IPV-1s are used only to hold down essentially secure systems and rarely get the most promising recruits as crew. IPV-1 crews also develop strong relationships with local officials and businessmen, since the IPV-1 Patrol Craft has no [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) and is normally assigned to the same system for years at a time. This situation leads to creeping laxity regarding military protocol, or even corruption and outright rebellion. An IPV-1 makes a perfect pirate ship if it can find a vessel able to carry it through Hyperspace or can have a [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) installed- a fact not lost on the crews of such ships.

### Capabilities
Though a [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship), an IPV-1 Patrol Craft isn't primarily designed to fight other [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships). its an antipirate vessel, focused on catching and destroying smaller ships, especially armed light freighters. An IPV-1 Patrol Craft can take a considerable amount of damage for its size, but its short-range [Light Turbolasers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Turbolasers) pose little threat to anything bigger than a frigate. As its crews are fond of saying, however, an IPV-1 can outrun anything it can't outfight. Lacking a [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) of its own, an IPV-1 Patrol Craft depends on powerful ion engines to get it into action before targets can escape into Hyperspace.

During the Galactic Civil War, numerous IPV-1s were used for missions far from their original design expectations. Before the development of the *[[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/lancer-class-frigate.md|Lancer]]*[[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/lancer-class-frigate.md|-Class Frigate]], some Imperial commanders used spare IPV-1s as escort vessels, either carried inside a [Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Destroyer) or equipped with jury-rigged [Hyperdrives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrives).
