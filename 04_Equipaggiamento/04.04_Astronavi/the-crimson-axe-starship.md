*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

The *Crimson Axe* is a formidable pirate vessel captained by the notorious [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/feeorin.md|Feeorin]] pirate, [Rav](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rav). The ship has a distinctive vertical configuration, with massive angled hull plating recalling the shape of a primitive axe head- thus its name. Atop this massive structure sits the command and control decks. The armored hull not only protects the ship from attack but also gives it a devastating ramming capability that tears and punctures lightly armored freighters or lesser military craft.

Several hangars allow fighters, freighters, and other craft to dock or be brought aboard. The main hangar is located at the front of the vessel, protected by huge armor-plated doors. Several smaller hangars are located on the decks below the main engines, with their entrances facing aft. The ship is also outfitted with a [Tractor Beam](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tractor_Beam) to pull debris and disabled craft aboard.

Rav's ship and most of his vile crew bears the Bloody Bones symbol, a distinctive, red X-shaped mark that immediately identifies them as dangerous, brutal, and self-serving pirates. For many years, they boldy attack ships and settlements throughout [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) and other regions of the galaxy. They are opportunistic and operate anywhere that might provide them with credits, goods, or ransom payments.

During the war between [The Galactic Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Alliance) and the Empire, The *Crimson Axe* ransacks defeated bases and settlements, or occasionally sifts through the debris fields of massive space battles. The crew delights in easy pickings and quick scores. One of the ship's greatest achievements is the sacking of the Jedi Temple on [Ossus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ossus), two days after it falls to Sith and Imperial forces.

The defeat of [The Galactic Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Alliance) and the reemergence of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) under Sith control makes piracy more difficult. At the end of the war, The *Crimson Axe* is forced to return to its earlier ways, though it occasionally benefits from the ongoing battles between the Empire and its enemies. Eventually, Rav decides that there is better and easier money to be made in bail bonds and acting as a coordinator for bounty hunters.

Rav turns the ship into his base of operations on [Socorro](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Socorro), dropping the tall, pointed vessel into a massive, ancient [Sarlacc Pit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlacc_Pit) in an outcropping above the Killee Wasteland. From its high perch, it overlooks the vast black sands of the surrounding landscape. The ship towers over the small city of Killee-Kor, built throughout the rocky cliffs and mesas long ago. Like many settlements on [Socorro](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Socorro), Killee-Kor is a haven of underworld activity and home to hundreds of fringe-dwellers.

Bounty hunters and less savory individuals often visit The *Crimson Axe* to confer with Rav. The pirate promotes the idea that the ship is still operational, and could be used to leave at his command, but many speculate that it has become a permanent fixture of the Killee Wasteland.
