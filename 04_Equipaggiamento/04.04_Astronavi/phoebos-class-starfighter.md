Often classified as a "Sport" Starfighter, the *Phoebos*-Class Starfighter from Ubrikkian Transports is one of the fastest personnel Starfighters on the market. Designed to cater to the wealthy, the *Phoebos*-Class Starfighter is built for speed, speed, and more speed. Though fast in the atmosphere of a planet, the *Phoebos*-Class Starfighter truly excels in open space. Sleek, aerodynamic, and visually appealing, the *Phoebos*-Class is also frequently found in Starfighter racing circuits throughout the galaxy. It is particularly popular among the "New Nobles" that have risen to prominence as a result of the return of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire), and many young nobles consider the ownership (And modification) of this Starfighter to be something of a status symbol.

Ubrikkian actually began manufacturing the *Phoebos*-Class Starfighter in response to the Imperial restrictions on personnel [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) ownership. By ostensibly creating the fighter as a Vehicle for personnel recreation, Ubrikkian was able to get a top-of-the-line Starfighter onto the market when many other manufacturers were being forced to cease production of their own models, or (In most cases) convert their manufacturing facilities to produce ships and other material for the Empire. Moreover, the Starfighter they produced, though delicate by many standards, also boast moderate defense systems, including relatively powerful shields (Described by Ubrikkian Transports as "Custom engineered to deflect errant space debris while traveling at high speeds") and [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons).

The *Phoebos*-Class Starfighter is popular among wealthy crime lords and small-time smugglers and thieves. Though expensive to procure through legitimate channels, *Phoebos*-Class Starfighters are among the most commonly stolen personnel Starships in the galaxy. Ubrikkian Transports counters this by offering a free security upgrade for owners, in the form of a HoloNet enabled tracking device. Unfortunately for these owners, the Empire also requires Ubrikkian Transports to turn over the tracking data for all *Phoebos*-Class ships at the time of purchase, meaning that this security upgrade is often one of the first things removed from the ship by the new owner.
