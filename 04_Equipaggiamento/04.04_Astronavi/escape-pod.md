| ESCAPE POD | EMPLACEMENT POINTS | AVAILABILITY | SIZE RESTRICTION | COST |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small Lifeboat | 1 | Common | Colossal or Larger | 400 (Base) |
| Large Lifeboat | 2 | Common | Colossal (Frigate) or Larger | 800 (Base) |

All [Space Transports](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transports) and [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) automatically include enough Escape Pods for all living passengers and crew- they're built into the cost of the ship. By law, Starships are required to have sufficient Escape Pods on board at all times, but military Starships are exempt from this rule and may carry fewer than the normal amount (see [Gaining Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gaining_Emplacement_Points)).

If a Colossal or larger Starship is destroyed, any character on board who survives may make a DC 20 [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) check to reach an Escape Pod. On a failed check, the character is stuck in a bit of wreckage that has enough air and heat to keep them alive for about an hour. (Obviously, a character who gets into an Escape Pod prior to a ship's destruction does not need to make a check.)

Typical Escape Pods are small, single-use [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) providing 1 day of life support for eight Medium creatures plus rations for another week and just enough fuel to reach a nearby planet. Many large ships upgrade their Escape Pods to more capable models.

### Small Lifeboats
These vessels, which can be installed on ships of Colossal size or larger, provide life support for up to fifteen Medium creatures for up to 1 week, and they have enough fuel to fly across a star system to reach a habitable planet.

They include extensive survival gear, including emergency shelters, 1 week of rations, water purifiers, and a small hunting blaster. One bay includes ([Cost Modifier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cost_Modifier_(SotG)))/50 Small Lifeboats, and multiple bays may be installed.

### Large Lifeboats
These vessels, which can be installed on ships of Colossal (Frigate) size or larger, provide life support for up to 50 Medium creatures for up to 2 months, and they include a Class 15 [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) with enough fuel for a single Hyperspace jump (plus a little left over for the ion engines and repulsorlifts to use during landing).

Survival gear is similar to that of a Small Lifeboat (see above). One bay includes ([Cost Modifier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cost_Modifier_(SotG)))/100 Large Lifeboats, and multiple bays may be installed.
