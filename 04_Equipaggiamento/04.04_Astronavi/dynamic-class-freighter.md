The *Dynamic*-Class Freighter is a sturdy if rare type of Starship whose origins date back to the earliest days of the Old Republic. Manufactured by a subsidiary of Core Galaxy Systems based on the planet [Transel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Transel), the *Dynamic*-Class Freighter has been produced only in limited quantities by a single factory on that obscure, backwater world. The manufacturing plant that produces the *Dynamic*-Class Freighter was originally the production facility for a small, independent Starship engineering firm that was purchased by Core Galaxy Systems during a period of rapid company expansion. However, in ensuring reorganizations, little attention was paid to the *Dynamic*-Class Freighter of it's manufacturing plant, and as a result the ship continued to be produced for many years, using the funding from Core Galaxy Systems to build each vessel one at a time.

[[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/the-ebon-hawk.md|The *Ebon Hawk*]] was a heavily modified *Dynamic*-Class Freighter that played an integral role in [The Jedi Civil War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Civil_War).

### Capabilities
The *Dynamic*-Class Freighter gets its name from the ease with which it is modified. The ship is particularly well suited for customization, and the hand-crafted feel that each vessel possesses only enhances this reputation. Though not particularly fast or tough, the ship is sturdy and can handle extensive modifications without losing any efficiency. When a character attempts to make a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to [Repair](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair) or modify (See [Starship Modifications](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Modifications)) a *Dynamic*-Class Freighter, that character gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the skill check.

The basic model of the ship does not have impressive armament or any shielding, though the manufacturers were sure to engineer the vessel to allow the ship to accept such modifications with ease. Less spacious than large freighters such as the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/corellian-yt-1300-transport.md|Corellian YT-1300 Transport]], a *Dynamic*-Class Freighter can hold less cargo but maintains the ability to transport a number of passengers, making it a more utilitarian Starship than most freighters.
