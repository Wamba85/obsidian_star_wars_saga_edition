Designed to be a scouting and trade vessel, the Z-10 *Seeker*-Class ultimately found its place in the galaxy working as a small courier ship or a high-speed light freighter.

When the engineers at Starfeld Industries designed the Z-10, they hoped to create a Starship that was small enough to accommodate a small crew complement but efficient enough to perform well for its owner. In many ways, they reached their goal. The Z-10 Scout Ship is what many designers call a "Tight Design," meaning that it makes the most out of the space it has available and runs well as long as it is properly maintained with regular checkups and repaired with the recommended parts.

For many owners that enjoy the opportunity to customize their ships, a "Tight Design" means that the ship breaks down if not kept up often and does not easily take nonstandard parts. The "Tight Design" also means very little space is available to add other systems that the owner may wish to introduce to the ship, and removing any systems to make room for those additional features the owner will add may end up affecting other systems in the process, creating even more problems that need to be dealt with before the ship can fly again. In fact, the stock version of this ship has no available [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points). If the owner is crafty enough to make space for a new system, any [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) checks made to install new systems to the ship receive a -5 penalty, and the time to install the new system is doubled.

However, people that use the ship have little reason to modify the ship. The Z-10's superb maneuverability rating coupled with its high rate of speed and low crew requirement make the ship an excellent choice for those individuals and organizations needing to reach their destination quickly and with very few, if any, delays. Plus, the Z-10 comes with a high-grade [Sensor Enhancement Package](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sensor_Enhancement_Package) that helps the ship avoid any entanglements with any vessels that come between it and its destination.

The sensors do have the disadvantage of being directly tied to the ship's weapon targeting system. If the sensors go offline during combat, the weapons lose any bonuses it would normally have from the ship's [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), taking a -2 penalty to all attacks until the sensors are back online. In addition, if the weapons are damaged for any reason, the sensors shut down due to a feedback loop created by the targeting system. When one factors this in with the ship's weak hull and lack of shields, it becomes evident that the Z-10 *Seeker*-Class was never intended to see combat, and exercising discretion is the better course of action when faced with a potential adversary.

The Z-10 Seeker has only 5 tons of cargo space built into the ship, but it is capable of carrying up to 2 standard [Heavy Cargo Pods](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Cargo_Pods) attached to the main fuselage, bringing the total cargo capacity for the ship to 45 tons. The ship even has a built-in [Cargo Jettison System](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cargo_Jettison_System) that allows the pilot to jettison the [Cargo Pods](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cargo_Pods) in case of an emergency. As a result, standard [Cargo Pods](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cargo_Pods) can be attached without having to be specially modified, saving the owner thousands of credits.

### History
Starfeld Industries originally created the Z-10 *Seeker*-Class as a ship for those customers that involve themselves in scouting or low-volume trade. Though the company had high hopes for their newest ship model, their timing could not be worse. Due to events they could not foresee that influenced the market (namely the emergence of the Separatists and the events that led to the Clone Wars), sales were extremely low. Their profits were so low, that the company almost went bankrupt.

The sudden change in the economy forced the company to change their advertising strategy. Fortunately, the adjustment was made at about halfway into the war, a time when many enterprising individuals looked for a fast ship. When Starfeld shifted their promotional style and sold the Z-10 to couriers, delivery companies and small freight forwarders, sales picked up and helped the company survive well past the conclusion of the war and into the height of the Empire.

Unfortunately, many of the companies that were contracted by Starfeld to provide various components for the Z-10, such as Miradyne Computer Systems, went out of business shortly after the Z-10 was first introduced. The abrupt loss of support for many of the ship's key systems made replacement parts for the Z-10 extremely rare, and very few companies manufactured alternate components. Even some systems that were purchased from companies that survived the economic recession, such as BlasTech Industries, were just as proprietary as the ones from the failed businesses and created a technical nightmare for anyone attempting to repair the ship.

Despite the problems that creeped in, many owners still hold on to their Z-10s, especially if they succeeded in modifying the vessel to the specs they wanted. Besides, many potential owners would turn down a used ship after seeing the changed the previous owner made and realized that the ship would not perform in a manner to their liking. Finding a stock version of a Z-10 Seeker is a rare find in the galaxy, and one that is in good operating condition is even rarer still.

### Z-10 *Seeker*-Class Scout Ships in the Galaxy
Most Z-10s that people will see can be found flying short distances between planets of virtually any region of the galaxy. Many pilots use their ships for delivering small loads of cargo or important documents either within the same star system or to another planet within the same sector. Why they choose not to use the ship for longer jumps or much laborious trips becomes obvious when maintenance is considered. With the little amount of available parts available for repairs to be done, pilots do not want to take the chance of taxing the ship's systems too much and risk it breaking down.

Smugglers that own a Z-10 decided to take advantage of the stereotype the ship provides and portray themselves as small-time couriers making a delivery. In many ways, they are not lying. But, the idea that such a cramped ship could not possibly carry any hidden contraband is prominent in the minds of many law enforcement officers, and they allow the ship through without a second thought.

Certain individuals with the desire to have a personal transport of their own like the appeal of the Z-10. Low crew requirements and just enough space to accommodate the pilot's personal belongings make the ship attractive to those wanting to get away from the crowded [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds).
