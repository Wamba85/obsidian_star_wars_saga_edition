With the end of the Clone Wars, the Empire was faced with the difficult task of overseeing a galaxy that had been in open conflict for years. Vast areas of space had to be patrolled, and the only practical way of doing so was to construct thousands of small [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters). The existing Republic Starfighters were seen as too expensive to maintain for years of patrolling, and much too expensive to build in larger numbers.The Empire required a cheap and efficient fighter that could be mass-produced. Dozens of shipyards vied for the contract to provide those ships, but Sienar Fleet Systems especially impressed the Emperor with its Twin Ion Engine prototype fighter. These fighters cost only a fraction to build compared to other proposals, and Sienar could begin production immediately.

The first prototype TIEs were actually tougher than the final version, but they also cost more. They featured weak shields, a small [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), and two one-shot [Concussion Missile Launchers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion_Missile_Launchers), to allow them to serve as light bombers, long-assault craft, and snub fighters. However, the Twin Ion Engine was incompatible with many of those systems, requiring the TIE Prototype to carry a secondary power supply for them. When the Empire decided to make numerous variant fighters, the decision was made to remove these generators for the basic [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/tie-fighter.md|TIE Fighter]] (Reducing costs significantly, resulting in construction in vast numbers).

Even so, the TIE Prototype was built in the hundreds for numerous test runs, and it remained very popular with its pilots (If not the Imperial accountants). In the first years of the New Order, squads of TlE Prototypes, or units of older fighters (Often [ARC-170s](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/ARC-170s) or [V-Wings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/V-Wings)) with a TIE Prototype wing commander, were common. The ships became less common later, because they required parts and maintenance that were nonstandard, and only truly elite pilots could insist on keeping the older ships. By the time the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/tie-interceptor.md|TIE Interceptor]] and more advanced fighters were commonly available, most TIE Prototypes were replaced or scrapped, though a few were kept as personal vessels of Moffs and similar high-ranking officers.
