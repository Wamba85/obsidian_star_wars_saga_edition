*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

Developed in the early stages of the Clone Wars by Kuat Drive Yards, the *Skyfire*-Class Heavy Assault Cruiser was a dangerous weapons platform. The ship was designed to take out fortified enemy structures and capital-scale targets, but also found a niche as ground support against dense formations of Battle Droids. The cruiser uses a single rail gun similar in concept to a Wookiee [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/bowcaster.md|Bowcaster]] to deal devastating amounts of damage with its emerald energy-encased explosive rounds to targets.

The extreme power requirements for the weapon and shields means a reduced amount of power was available for engines, and as such the cruiser was abnormally sluggish for its size. Its slow speed is exacerbated even more by the mass of its heavy hull plating. The excessive cost combined with the absence of a [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), the painfully slow fire rate of the weapon and its obvious weakness versus fighter screens prohibited the craft from seeing widespread use. It was wholly replaced by the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/ntb-630-naval-bomber.md|NTB-630 Naval Bomber]], [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/ptb-625-planetary-bomber.md|PTB-625 Planetary Bomber]], and later by the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/arc-170-starfighter.md|ARC-170 Starfighter]].

### Capabilities
The advanced heavy rail gun system on the Skyfire-Class Heavy Assault Cruiser was among one of the most deadly armaments in use by the Republic during the Clone Wars. The rounds are energized by the ship’s power generator and polarizers on the tips of its wings magnetically accelerate the energized bolt out of the cannon where it explodes upon contact. The blast radius is so massive that a single shot is capable of destroying several small craft in a tight formation upon a successful hit with one. Because the capacitors need time to build up energy for each round, the weapon can only be fired once every three rounds.
