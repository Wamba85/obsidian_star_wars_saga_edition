*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

The *Star Galleon*-Class Frigate was initially conceived as a transport vessel that could escort itself in hostile space. Given the rise of piracy on major trade routes, combined with the Navy's need to wage a civil war on a galactic scale, such a design was heartily embraced by Imperial Command. Since its introduction, the *Star Galleon* has earned a reputation for being nearly impossible to capture. Only the most desperate pirate bands dare to assault a *Star Galleon*, and even then they do so at great risk.

### Capabilities
With its thick armor, heavy deflector shields, and formidable weaponry, the *Star Galleon*-Class Frigate is able to stand its ground against small [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) and snub fighters. Ideally, it is supposed to be deployed in flotillas of between three and five such vessels, with each providing covering fire for the rest. The ships are more often encountered at the center of a supply convoy, supported by several smaller escort ships. Despite their durability and firepower, *Star Galleons* are slow and sluggish when compared to their adversaries, and additional escort, when available, is always preferred.

The defensibility of the *Star Galleon*-Class Frigate doesn't end with its armament and shielding. Strategically designed choke points combine with reinforced emplacements to provide the ship's guards with a limitless supply of defensible positions. As many as 300 troops, typically drawn from the ranks of Imperial Naval troopers, can be assigned to defend a single *Star Galleon*-Class Frigate.

As if this wasn't enough, the *Star Galleon's* cargo hold is nestled in the center of the craft. The hold is designed as a separate vessel, equipped with its own [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive). In dire circumstances, the cargo hold can be detached and enter Hyperspace, conveying itself and its contents to a designated point in space. Imperial forces, informed of the hold's location by homing beacon, can then retrieve the cargo.
