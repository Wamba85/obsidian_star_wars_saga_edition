*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

When the Republic's clone army invaded [Geonosis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Geonosis), its [*Acclamator*-Class Assault Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acclamator-Class_Assault_Ships), [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters), and [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/laat-i-gunship.md|LAAT/i Gunships]] were met in orbit by swarms of Territorial Starfighters. Though the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] defenses were eventually swept aside, their swift response to the Republic's invasion force bought the Confederacy enough time to mobilize its ground forces. Instead of accepting defeat at the hands of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) and their clone legions, the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] military castes became even more devoted to the cause of the Confederacy. The defeat of their homeworld polarized their support for the Separatists and became a rallying cry for the entire Species. Though limited in numbers, the *Nantex*-Class Territorial Starfighters were a common sight in just about every major battle to come.

### Capabilities
The *Nantex*-Class Territorial Starfighter, dubbed the "Beak Wing" by the Republic navy, is a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]]-designed interceptor. Though underestimated by many pilots in the early days of the Clone Wars, the *Nantex* soon earned a fearsome reputation. Despite its small size, the *Nantex* is a durable and effective craft in the hands of a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] pilot.

From the time each one hatches, a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] pilot is paired with a specific flight computer. This has the effect of forming a seamless bond with the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) and their [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter). So strong is this connection that [Pilots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilots) who lose their ships in combat often waste away and die within weeks of the loss. The fighter's avionics are tailored to [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] physiology, and they include pheromone emitters and specialized scent stimulators. Though this makes the craft impossible for members of other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to operate, it serves to further increase the frightening efficiency of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] pilots.

The *Nantex*-Class Territorial Starfighter is modular and easily configurable to a number of different mission profiles. The forward section of the fighter is equipped with scores of small tractor-beam emitters that are used to increase the accuracy of the fighter's [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons). As a result, a *Nantex* within 2 squares of a target gains a +1 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on attack rolls. *Nantex*-Class Territorial Starfighters have been clocked at over 20,000 km/h under optimal atmospheric conditions, but effective maneuvers are practically impossible at such speeds.
