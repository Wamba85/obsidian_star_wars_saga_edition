*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

The S40K is one of Kuat Systems Engineering's first forays into the galactic starship market. Designed as an affordable [Space Transport](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transport) with minimal cargo capacity, good defenses, and high utility, the *Phoenix Hawk*-Class falls short in a number of areas, and these shortcomings eventually doom it to failure. So many corners are cut by KSE's designers that the *Phoenix Hawk*-Class is essentially ignored by wealthy pilots and merchants in favor of more expensive, less cramped alternatives. Externally, the *Phoenix Hawk*-Class resembles a squat [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/firespray-31-patrol-craft.md|Firespray-31 Patrol Craft]]. Unlike the Firespray, which is streamlined and elegant in appearance, the *Phoenix Hawk*-Class appears ungainly and clumsy.

The ship's starkest deficiency is its cramped living conditions. Though marketed as a transport for up to six occupants, the craft's amenities are hardly sufficient for half that number. Crew and passengers are pressed together into small quarters, and bunks must be shared if the ship is staffed to full capacity. Standard ceiling height within the S40K is capped at 1.83 meters, making the interior a claustrophobe's nightmare. To make matters worse, refresher facilities are uncomfortable and prone to malfunctioning at inopportune times unless several systems are replaced with nonstandard parts.

Despite its drawbacks, the S40K succeeds in the area of defensive systems and offensive capabilities. Though it is slow and plodding in flight, the *Phoenix Hawk*-Class is equipped with excellent shields and powerful weaponry. When flown by a skilled pilot, the S40K makes a formidable target, so it is popular with bounty hunters, mercenaries, and paramilitary units that are less concerned with amenities and more interested in the application of brute force.

Though it is an incredibly common sight on the space lanes during the days of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic), the *Phoenix Hawk*-Class becomes increasingly obscure with each passing decade.
