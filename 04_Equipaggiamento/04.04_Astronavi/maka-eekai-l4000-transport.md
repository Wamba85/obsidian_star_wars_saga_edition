The Maka-Eekai L4000 is among the largest transports ever built for the independent freighter market. Although bulk freighters are often much more massive, the Maka-Eekai is still designed to be operated by a single independent captain, rather than a large corporation, well-connected cartels, or a government. Though two-thirds the size of Gallofree Yards' common [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/gr-75-medium-transport.md|GR-75 Medium Transport]], the Maka-Eekai has less than 10% of the cargo capacity due to its focus on comfort and maneuverability rather than just storage space. The hope was that wealthy independent merchants would pay a premium to haul their loads in comfort and style.The design program that produced this model began in the latter days of the Republic, and the first model rolled off the line just as the Clone Wars began in earnest. As a result, sales were poor, prompting the manufacturer to cut the price considerably. Although this tactic did boost sales, the financial hit sustained by Gallofree Yards was considerable, and the manufacturer never truly recovered. No further production runs were attempted, and though the Maka-Eekai is a common sight in the years shortly after the Clone Wars, a few years after the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin) most are gone. Because they shared many components with larger transports, most Maka-Eekai are eventually scrapped for parts to repair larger ships that have ten times their cargo capacity.

Most Maka-Eekai are configured primarily as cargo haulers, with room for only a few passengers but hundreds of tons of cargo. It's possible to convert cargo space into roomy accommodations, at the rate of 10 tons of cargo per additional passenger (To a maximum of forty passengers). Many Maka-Eekai are produced with different cargo/passenger mixes as standard stock options at no additional​​​​​​​ cost. Of course, most of this tonnage goes to stowage for six months of food for an additional person as well as more life support equipment, living facilities, and galley space- people carried in cargo space for only a very short trip (Such as refugees) don't take up anything close to 10 tons.

The only armament in a stock Maka-Eekai is the two Double [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons) mounted in turrets on either side of the ship. However, a common addition is a set of [Fire-Linked](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire-Linked) Laser Cannons in a ball turret found at the end of a gun boom. The boom doubles as a stabilizing fin, swinging to the back of the ship for both landing and lightspeed travel but projecting below the ship for normal space travel. Access to the ball turret is through a tunnel running the length of the gun boom, a maneuver most easily accomplished in zero gravity. Because it is aimed at an independent market, the Maka-Eekai uses a surprising amount of space for targeting computers, maneuvering thrusters, and sensors, making even stock versions far more combat-ready than their rotund appearance would suggest.
