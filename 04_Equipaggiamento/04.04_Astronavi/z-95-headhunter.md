The Z-95 Headhunter is a venerable Starfighter design that still sees use throughout the galaxy. Even though it is no longer produced, either by Incom Industries or Subpro Corporation, unlicensed copies and variants can be found throughout [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). Without taking into account the number of knock-offs in circulation, there are still more Headhunters in service with planetary fleets, customs personnel, paramilitary organizations, and law enforcement agencies than any other [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter).

The original Headhunters were more akin to atmospheric fighters than Starships. After several generations of continued development, the Z-95 was close to the form and function that it would become famous for. The [T-65B X-Wing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/T-65B_X-Wing) owes much of its success to the Z-95, and the two craft are obvious cousins when placed side by side. It should come as little surprise that many of the galaxy's heroes have flown the Headhunter on more than one occasion.

For its time in [Republic Navy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Republic_Vehicles), the Z-95 Headhunter was a state-of-the-art Starfighter that made an indelible mark on the galaxy. Space combat tactics of the time were designed with the Z-95 in mind, and many modern maneuvers are based on those originally flown in the Headhunter by the Starfighter aces of yesteryear.

### Capabilities
The stock Z-95 Headhunter is not equipped with [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) engines, but it wasn't long before Alliance technicians created a number of variant Headhunters that could transverse Hyperspace. Prior to implementing [Hyperdrives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrives), [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) was reluctant to assign the craft to its fleet, instead keeping a handful of Headhunters for short-range defense in remote sectors. Though still a relative rarity in the Alliance Fleet, they are ubiquitous enough to be utilized for sensitive operations in areas where their discovery will not immediately reveal the Alliance's presence  the same way that an [A-Wing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/A-Wing) or [X-Wing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing) would.

Another point in favor of the Z-95 Headhunter is its durability and ease of repair. It is a rugged craft that can take a beating and keep flying. Use of the craft is so widespread, and so many have been manufactured over the years, that it is a simple matter to find spare parts, even on most backwater worlds.
