*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

These cargo freighters were a relic left over from a time before the Trade Federation was controlled by the [Neimoidians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Neimoidians). This medium freighter was a mainstay of the Trade Federation fleet decades before the Invasion of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo). When the Senate approved legislation allowing corporations to assemble and maintain their own anti-piracy security forces, the Trade Federation used it as an opportunity to create armies of Battle Droids and began retrofitting their cargo vessels to act as warships.

Though these craft were capable of adapting to the changes quite easily, they were hardly cost effective. The additions and modifications to an already pricy craft were deemed too expensive. Haor Chall Engineering solved the Trade Federation's problem by creating the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/c-9979-landing-craft.md|C-9979 Landing Craft]]- cheaper landing craft designed specifically for the armies of the Trade Federation. This, mixed with the introduction of the [*Lucrehulk*-Class Cargo Haulers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lucrehulk-Class_Cargo_Haulers) pushed these freighters out of the mainstream.

### Capabilities
Although these craft were originally designed as medium cargo freighters, during the Clone Wars these craft are rarely seen at all, let alone in their stock configuration. The majority of these vessels had sizable portions of their cargo space converted to hangar bays. Variations were numerous, but inside the 250-meter long by 60-meter wide hull, the transport normally facilitated 1,000 [Hangar Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hangar_Points) and storage to hold 1,200 Battle Droids.

Stock versions of this craft are a common sight along the space lanes in the centuries before the Clone Wars, but begin to be phased out approximately 50 years before the start of the Clone Wars. Regardless, modified versions of this freighter can be found rented out to conscripts of the Confederacy, and at low-priority points where supplies are scarce.
