The NavaSword is Subpro's attempt to break out into a larger, galaxywide market. Despite the fact that Subpro designed many successful Starhips and aided in the design of some of the most successful designs of its era (Such as the [Z-95 Headhunter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Z-95_Headhunter)), its location far from [The Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core_Worlds) causes it to be seen as a second-rate designer. Although Subpro made many designs built by the Incom Corporation (Including the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/arc-170-starfighter.md|ARC-170 Starfighter]]), Subpro never received a full share of the money made, nor extensive credit for its part in these designs. Not wanting to be dependent on Incom, early in the Clone Wars Subpro sets out to build its own successor to the Z-95, a multipurpose Starfighter named the NovaSword.

The NovaSword is a nimble, powerful craft that boasts many improvements over the [Z-95 Headhunter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Z-95_Headhunter). With fair shields, high speed, great maneuverability, and in integral [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), the NovaSword is a versatile fighter able to act as an interceptor, light bomber, or scout. The vessel is designed to be operated by a single [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)), but it has a second seat that can be used by a passenger or can hold a [Copilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Copilot), [Commander](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander), [System Operator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/System_Operator), or [Engineer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Engineer) (Though not a [Gunner](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunner)). This feature allows a small force to assign just one trained pilot to each NovaSword and have an effective fighting force, or a larger organization to assign two crewmembers per fighter to gain additional utility from each ship.

The design should be a great success. However, Subpro's reputation prevented [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) (And later [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire)) from buying any of the new fighter, and relatively low numbers were built. Although a few planetary defense forces and large business groups buy small fleets of NovaSwords, they are most commonly sold to private buyers, including mercenaries and bounty hunters. The high price of the [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) is one reason its success has been limited to wealthier groups.

The Separatists managed to buy several dozen NovaSwords for use by elite commanders in their fleet. Durge used a NovaSword as his personal fighter for much of the Clone Wars. When the [X-Wing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/X-Wing) was produced by Incom several years later, the NovaSword was largely forgotten.
