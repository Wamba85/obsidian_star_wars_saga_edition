*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

According to captured Separatist records, only six *Ginivex*-Class Starfighters were manufactured by the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosians]] for Count Dooku. Referred to as "Fanblades" due to their distinctive fan-shaped Solar Sails, these fighters were as effective as they were exotic. Dooku eventually bequeathed the six fighters to his disciple, Asajj Ventress, who had them transported to her homeworld of [Rattatak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rattatak). In a short time, the unique Starfighters became Ventress's calling card, striking dread into any pilot unlucky enough to face one in combat.

During the course of the Clone Wars, Asajj Ventress suffered the theft of two of her fighters by Obi-Wan Kenobi and his padawan, Anakin Skywalker. The last known location of these appropriated ships was the Jedi Temple on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant), but it is assumed that they were subsequently destroyed or taken by the Emperor during the Jedi Purge. Ventress's remaining four ships vanished with her, and their whereabouts are currently unknown. Rumors that several "Fanblade" Fighters took place in the Second Battle of [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) remain unconfirmed.

### Capabilities
The *Ginivex's* Solar Sail is its most distinctive asset. Although it increases the target silhouette of the fighter and makes it stand out like a small sun on shipboard sensors, it also serves as a transmission plane for deflector shield energy. The Solar Sail increases the *Ginivex's* [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating) from 30 to 45, so long as it is deployed. The extra 15 points of SR are depleted before any others, and they recharge at the normal rate. If the Solar Sail is retracted, any SR is provides is immediately lost. As an added bonus, the Solar Sail can be used to propel the *Ginivex* if its sublight thrusters are damaged.

Like other [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] fighters, the *Ginivex* boasts impressive speed and maneuverability. Unlike other [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] designs, such as the *Nantex*-Class Territorial Starfighter, the *Ginivex* is designed specifically for humanoid [Pilots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilots); none of the standard [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] avionics are included in the design. In another deviation from [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/geonosian.md|Geonosian]] fighter doctrine, the *Ginivex*-Class is equipped with an integral [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) engine and a limited-use [Navicomputer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Navicomputer). These additions were incorporated at great expense and at the insistence of Count Dooku.
