Cheap and efficient, TIE Fighters are not so much feared for their capabilities as their numbers. Mass-produced by Sienar Fleet Systems, TIE Fighters cost only a fraction of what a comparable fighter costs. Keeping the price down means that TIE Fighters have no shields, hyperdrives, or life support- not even cockpit gravity. They can't even land without special supports. The Imperial Navy believes that this teaches pilots to rely on higher authorities. In reality, it just teaches them to hope that they live long enough to be promoted to a more advanced TIE variant.

## Additional TIE Fighter Data
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

[The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire), wanting to standardize its [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) Fleet with smaller ships, selected the TIE Fighter to replace a number of disparate models that were currently in use. In time, and with continual upgrades to the design, the TIE/In became the standard Imperial Starfighter. It is relatively inexpensive to produce, and though often maligned by both Imperial and Alliance pilots, it is nonetheless effective.

### Capabilities
In order to save on production costs, the TIE/In lacks many of the features that are considered to be standard on other [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters). The relatively fragile craft is not equipped with a [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), or a life support system. In order to survive the rigors of space when piloting their fighters, TIE [Pilots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilots) must don distinctive, fully sealed [Flight Suits](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flight_Suit). Without the proper support or docking scaffolds, TIE Fighters are also unable to land in any sort of conventional manner.

Although the TIE's versatility is somewhat limited by these deficiencies, it does have several points in its favor. its agility, combined with its small size and speed, makes it a difficult target for all but the most talented or well-trained gunners. TIE Fighters, being inexpensive and easy to produce, are deployed in large quantities. Imperial Starfighter tactics stress that enemies must be overwhelmed by sheer force of numbers, and casualty rates among TIE pilots are much higher than average.
