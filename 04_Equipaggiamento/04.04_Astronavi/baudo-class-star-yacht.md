*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

The *Baudo*-Class Star Yacht is a favorite vessel of the galaxy's wealthy. It is especially popular among the younger set of spoiled rich kids who fancy themselves as rakes and bravos. It is a good-looking ship, with smooth, organic lines that are more reminiscent of a deep sea creature than a high-tech pleasure craft.

The manufacturer of the *Baudo* Yacht is a small shipyard owned by a reclusive and eccentric [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/aqualish.md|Aqualish]] named Mendel Baudo. His company produces every ship he makes on a custom-order basis, implementing each customer's requirements to produce a yacht that is both functional and opulent. The basic capabilities and external appearance of each vessel remain the same, but the internal amenities can differ vastly from ship to ship.

Baudo is a difficult being to find, and he accepts contracts only from people who are referred to him by his prior customers. He takes his time in the construction of each yacht, and he has been known to spend an entire standard year on a ship in an effort to get things precisely right. It is rumored that he keeps a couple of completed ships on hand for less discerning buyers, but he almost always insists on creating each ship to order.

### Capabilities
As far as star yachts go, the *Baudo* is a standard example of conspicuous consumption. No single *Baudo* is identical with any other one; each is built according to the requirements and specifications of it's buyer. The differences rarely affect the performance of the vessel; rather, they embellish the ship's luxury and appeal in ways that only the original owners will appreciate. One *Baudo* might have the internal bulkheads lined in polished hardwood and precious metals, while another might include a full bar complete with rare spirits from every system in the [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds).

Though relatively fast given its size, the *Baudo* is more attuned to a slow and steady pace. It doesn't accelerate particularly quick at sublight speeds, and it features only a Class 2 [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive). Despite these deficiencies, *Baudos* are simple to operate, and even amateur [Pilots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilots) find the controls easy to use. It's weapon and defense systems include only a single [Laser Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannon) and modest [Starship Shields](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Shields).
