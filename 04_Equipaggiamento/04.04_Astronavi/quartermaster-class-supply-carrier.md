*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

One of the first new ships to come off of the line after the Commercial Protectorate Acts, the *Quartermaster*-Class Supply Carrier is designed specifically to carry a variety of goods and raw materials to outlying worlds in desperate need of reconstruction or relief. Following the devastation of the Great Sith War, worlds throughout the Republic (And beyond) are in dire need of support for reconstructing their devastated infrastructures and for restoring their populations' health and prosperity. Some worlds are completely untouched by the Great Sith War, and others manage to maintain their industrial infrastructure despite occupation or their involvement in battles. Resources are funneled from these worlds to those that need help the most, but military ships are ill-equipped to carry provisions, supplies, and raw materials from one side of the galaxy to another.

This need gives rise to the *Quartermaster*-Class Supply Carrier. The size of a large [Space Transport](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transport), the 45-meter-long *Quartermaster*-Class Supply Carrier is mostly cargo space. It's systems and interior structure are highly modular, so the ship can be outfitted to carry a variety of cargoes, including liquids and gases. Though it has only a few minor defense systems, it's reinforced duranium hull allows it to withstand punishing damage without breaching and spilling it's cargo into space. By the time of the Mandalorian Wars, most of these vessels have been retired or sold on the secondary market because reconstruction efforts around the galaxy are mostly complete. One such vessel, The *Little Bivoli*, is used to supply Republic military forces at [Serroco](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Serroco).
