The Corellian YT-1760 Courier Transport releases a decade before the Clone Wars, and sells poorly on the open market. Its chief purchasers are smugglers and bounty hunters, who don't mind the limited cargo space and appreciate its easily modified nature, and benign appearance.

The YT1760's poor sales, combined with the need for warships during the Clone Wars prevented the model from ever seeing widespread production. By the time of [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era), the model is a rare sight. However, the ship is significant in that it was an early attempt at a stock ship from CEC that featured a central cockpit. Design elements from the YT-1760 would find their way into the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/corellian-yt-2000-transport.md|Corellian YT-2000 Transport]] years later.
### Capabilities
Like most CEC ships, the YT-1760 is fast and maneuverable for a ship of its size, and infinitely modifiable. The most common modifications included adding shields and a pair of quad laser cannons, though the stock model is built to run, not fight. Unlike most of the YT-series of light freighters, the YT-1760 was designed to act as a courier vessel, transporting high-value goods, personnel, or information, rather than bulk cargo.

Many individuals who transport VIPs reduce the number of passengers in favor of larger staterooms. Other common modifications include tuning the engines for greater speed, and concussion missile tubes. Also, a unique feature of the model included a shielded portion of the cargo bay, which is designed to hold high-value cargo, or act as a safe-room for VIPs during an assault. The shield has SR 20 for a 4x2 square area in the middle of the cargo bay.
