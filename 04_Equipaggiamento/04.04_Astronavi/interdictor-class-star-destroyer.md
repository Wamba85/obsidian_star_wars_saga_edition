The Immobilizer 418 *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer is a [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship) used to pull ships out of Hyperspace and prevent them from reentering, trapping them in Realspace and keeping them from escaping. The *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer uses four massive gravity well generators that produce a gravity shadow in Hyperspace (Similar to that projected by a planet or star) that makes Hyperspace travel through that area impossible. When an *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer has it's [Gravity Well Projectors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gravity_Well_Projectors) fired up, any ships traveling through Hyperspace in the vicinity immediately revert to Realspace, and no ship within a Hyperspace interdiction area can make the jump to lightspeed until the gravity well generators are shut down.

The *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer was developed in response to the hit-and-run tactics of [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance). The success of the *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer once again gave the Empire an advantage over Rebel tacticians, though fortunately for the Alliance, only a relatively small number of *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyers were converted for use during the Galactic Civil War. However, the ships were so successful that some [Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Destroyers) were retrofitted with [Gravity Well Projectors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gravity_Well_Projectors) in order to provide a more powerful platform for interdiction technology.

### Capabilities
The *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer is typically accompanied by a contingent of more heavily armed vessels, not only to lie in ambush but also to protect the *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer from the ships they are trapping. Pulling a Rebel fleet out of Hyperspace typically makes the *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer the primary target of the trapped fleet, and as a result the ship needs protection in order to keep from being destroyed.

Once the *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer has pulled the targets from Hyperspace, the ship's crew must keep the gravity wells focused on the trapped fleet; otherwise their prey will escape into Hyperspace simply by outrunning the Immobilizer and it's fellow ships. Directing a gravity well is no simple matter, requiring the same kind of precision and expertise as is required to operate a [Tractor Beam](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tractor_Beam), and the *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyers' crew is specially trained to maintain gravity wells in the heat of combat.

### Tactical Fire
The [*Vindicator*-Class Heavy Cruiser](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vindicator-Class_Heavy_Cruiser) and the *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer were both designed to keep enemy ships from fleeing, by the use of either firepower or gravity wells. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), an *Interdictor*-Class Star Destroyer can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 2-square radius around itself. All enemy Starships moving into that area must succeed on a DC 20 [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) check or stop moving for the remainder of the round. Once a ship is within this area, no further [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) checks are required, though if a ship leaves this area and then moves into it again, a new [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) check must be attempted.
