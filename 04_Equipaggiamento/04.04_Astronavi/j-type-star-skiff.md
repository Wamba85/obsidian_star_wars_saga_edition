As the Clone Wars raged and numerous Senators became increasingly uncomfortable with the political climate of the Republic, even the most peaceful of traditions had to be reexamined. The J-Type Star Skiff was the first diplomatic vessel of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo) to be armed (With a modest pair of Fire-Linked [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons)) and the first to have a gunner's console. Its design also sacrificed the sleek, all-chromium hull to place a more practical (And sturdy) access grills and powerful sublight engines. Still a thing of beauty, the Star Skiff was clearly designed with potential combat, escape, and repair in mind.

Though Queen Apailana of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo) herself never used the armed Star Skiff, it was loaned out to Senator Amidala, a sign of the Senator's great popularity with her homeworld and her monarch. After Amidala died, the Star Skiff was retired, because it had become a painful reminder of the Senator's last days in service to her people. However, other Senators, seeking to increase their own standing and political power, began purchasing similar vessels (Often with faux chromium, to save on costs).

### Capabilities
Lovingly and skillfully hand-crafted, as are all royal vessels built by the Theed Palace Space Vessel Engineering Corps, the J-Type Star Skiff is superior in design and construction to any mass-produced vessel. A Class 0.5 [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) allows it to carry out diplomatic missions with alacrity, its interior reflects the full comfort of an Advanced [Luxury Upgrade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luxury_Upgrade), and its considerable storage space allows any number of diplomatic gifts to be transported in style (And could even double as small cabins for a few guests). However, it also has [Laser Cannons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannons) that are augmented to the edge of laser technology, two medical beds, and a shield generator as powerful as those on most gunships. Though far too expensive to be practical as a warship, a J-Type Star Skiff could fly next to [N-1 Royal Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/N-1_Royal_Starfighters) as a flag vessel if the situation called for it.
