*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

The Low Altitude Assault Gunship, or LAAG as it came to be known, was one of the predecessors of the LAAT shortly before the Clone Wars began. The daughter company of Kuat Drive Yards, Rothana Heavy Engineering, produced a limited number of these craft during their research and development stage brought about by the secret military contract with the Kaminoans ten years before the onset of the Clone Wars. The Mark 2 design boasted shield generators, faster engines, and the inclusion of a [Proton Torpedo Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Torpedo_Launcher) over the short-lived Mark 1 model.

The LAAG-2 did see limited combat use during the Clone Wars, although the economy, versatility and all around superiority of the LAAT series gunships along with several other dedicated platforms such as the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/haet-221-gunboat.md|HAET-221 Gunboat]] and [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/isp.md|ISP]] ensured that focus would quickly be shifted away from the LAAG even before the fighting began.

Regardless of the drawbacks of this craft, Jedi General Echuu-Shen Jon preferred these craft over the replacement models due to the fact that the LAAG-2, [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/laab-2.md|LAAB-2]], and troop transports gave off nearly identical energy signatures on sensors, which confused the enemy and concealed the true strength of his military units.

### Capabilities
The LAAG-2 is a competent dogfighting snub fighter with an emphasis on air superiority. However, Rothana Heavy Engineering and the sly [Kaminoans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kaminoans) saw that their credits were more wisely spent on the LAAT, which was a larger offshoot model of the LAAG. The multi-role nature of the LAAT meant fewer ships and therefore less maintenance was needed, allowing them to streamline their pilot and technician training programs further, which in turn lowered the number of clones that needed to be devoted to logistics.

This no-brainer sealed the LAAG design's fate and the bulk of the production line was off-loaded to the Republic Navy's enlisted servicemen. Therefore it is just as common to see a non-clone Republic navy pilot operating this ship as it is a clone pilot. The LAAG has two remaining [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points) which are typically used in conjunction with specialist tinkering to increase the craft's Hit Points and armor, sometimes referred to as the Enhanced LAAG, or the LAAG-3.
