During the height of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic), the SoroSuub Corporation decided to design and build a [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) it could produce, modify, and utilize for its own needs. This patrol fighter was the Cutlass series, the last (and most successful) model of which was the Cutlass-9. Originally intended purely as a corporate asset, the Cutlass-9 Patrol Fighter was popular enough to spur some sales to other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), especially nonhumans. As [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic__Republic) began to groan under the weight of its own success, many humanocentric companies began treating nonhuman buyers as second-class citizens. SoroSuub never had that attitude, and sold many more Cutlass-9s as a result.

Once [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) came into power, SoroSuub had to tread a much more careful line. Having supported [The Confederacy of Independent Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems), the company had to take extreme measures to prove itself to the Empire. One such step was to stop production of the Cutlass-9 Patrol Fighter, which the Empire saw as a ship preferred by malcontents and rebels. By the time SoroSuub underwent an internal revolution and switched to supporting [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance), the rebels needed [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships) far more than fighters, and no further Cutlass-9s were built. Being sturdy and easily modified vessels, some survived in independant hands, but they became increasingly rare after the end of the Galactic Civil War.

### Capabilities
The basic Cutlass-9 was a simple fighter, with two mid-grade lasers and a single [Concussion Missile Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion_Missile_Launcher). It had a Class 2 [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) with a [Navicomputer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Navicomputer) and weak shields, making it a good long-range fighter when it was produced. Because it was always intended to be modified to suit the needs of SoroSuub, it was built with additional unused power conduits (giving it 3 unused [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points)). This additional capacity was often used to upgrade the shields or [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), or to add more powerful lasers and missile weapons. As the Clone Wars spurred the development of [Starfighters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighters), the Cutlass-9 Patrol Fighter went from cutting-edge to outdated. It was possible to upgrade it with the unused [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points), but few owners bothered.
