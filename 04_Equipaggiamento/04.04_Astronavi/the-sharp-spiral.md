*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

Gifted to Jedi Master Saesee Tiin by grateful [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/duros.md|Duros]] diplomats, The *Sharp Spiral* had been the focus of Tiin's limited personal time since the day he received it. The ship was flown in several sorties, and was a familiar sight to many Jedi. Master Tiin used this craft as a litmus test against the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/delta-7-aethersprite-interceptor.md|Delta-7 *Aethersprite* Interceptor]] when it was being test piloted by Jedi Master Adi Gallia, and later against the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/eta-2-actis-interceptor.md|Eta-2 *Actis* Interceptor]] as well.

The craft saw action on many worlds during the Clone Wars, including a singular incident involving a rogue faction of Freedom's Sons. However, during the latter half of the Clone Wars, Master Tiin was forced to eject from his fighter and injured a horn upon landing. The Sharp Spiral was undergoing severe repairs during the remainder of the Clone Wars, during which time Master Tiin flew an Eta-2 Interceptor.

The ship remained in the Jedi Temple hangar, still undergoing final repairs, when Master Tiin was killed in the confrontation with Darth Sidious. However, Senator Bail Organa was able to recover a Jedi Beacon from the ship, leading to his rendezvous with Masters Yoda and Kenobi. What became of the ship afterward is unknown.

### Capabilities
The ship was extensively modified, removing systems such as the full [Navicomputer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Navicomputer), [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating), and [Concussion Missiles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion_Missiles) to make way for a handcrafted [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), vastly improved [Maneuvering Jets](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maneuvering_Jets), and a [Proton Torpedo Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Proton_Torpedo_Launcher). The ship was also modified by some of the Jedi Temple's most gifted technicians to coax additional speed out of the atmospheric thrusters, making it the fastest ship [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) had, until the development of the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/eta-2-actis-interceptor.md|Eta-2 *Actis* Interceptor]].

Master Tiin is able to average an incredible x0.6 Hyperdrive rating, and will always choose to increase the difficulty of his Hyperspace jumps to cut the time to as much as one half the standard x1 travel time. Also note that Master Tiin had a [Jedi Meditation Chair](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Meditation_Chair) placed in the cockpit, allowing him to access all four space-based [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) it allows to be used in [Vehicle Combat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Combat). The Jedi Ace also had the controls for the fighter personalized.

The statistics given here assume a "Typical" [Crew Quality](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Crew_Quality) of Ace, though the stats do reflect the personalized controls as if Tiin were piloting; if the ship is encountered with Saesee Tiin flying it, his abilities may be used rather than those of a generic crew.
