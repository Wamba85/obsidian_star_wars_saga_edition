The *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer was the brainchild of designer Lire Blissex, who created it to serve as a multipurpose warship during the Clone Wars. Also called a Republic Attack Cruiser, the ship was very successful as an escort and a battle-group leader and often served as a flagship for Jedi commanders.

An able warship and among the most dangerous ships of its era, eventually the *Venator*-Class serves best as part of a massive fleet, acting as both a primary fighting ship and a [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) carrier while supporting numerous more specialized [Capital Ships](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ships). By itself, or as part of a group with smaller ships, the *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer lacks the ability to carry out long-range missions. Its relatively small capacity for supplies, coupled with its need for constant influx of dozens of new fighters and fighter parts, forces a *Venator*-Class to either stay near [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds) or support a long supply line of large freighters.

### Capabilities
Intended to be in the thick of the fighting beside its own [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) complement, the *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer carries several Point-Defense [Laser Cannon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Laser_Cannon) Batteries. These are the thickest around its massive flight deck, to ensure that enough firepower exists to prevent enemy fighters from entering the ship.

To allow its hundreds of fighters to quickly launch and be recovered, a *Venator*-Class has a dorsal flight deck with sliding armored doors. When a *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer's dorsal flight deck is opened, the ship's Armor bonus is reduced by 2 ([Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) 11 ([Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) 10)). After too many ships of the class were lost to hits into the open flight deck, the feature was abandoned for future [Star Destroyer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Destroyer) designs.

## Additional *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer Data
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

The *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer was designed by Lire Blissex as the ultimate capital-class warship of the Clone Wars. It went into service late in the war, however, and actually saw more service in the early days of the New Order. However, as icons of the Old Republic's military might, the ships were politically unpopular with the Empire's new propaganda offices. Additionally, their use as [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) carriers, using swarms of smaller ships for much of their combat power, didn't match well with the new Tarkin Doctrine. As a result, the *Venators* were put out of service as fast as new *Imperial*-Class ships could be built to replace them. Many were sold for scrap, only to appear in the hands of major criminal organizations or the Moffs private home defense fleets.

### Tactical Fire
A *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer is an excellent [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) carrier capable of operating close to the action and supporting its fighter corps. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Venator*-Class Star Destroyer can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 2-square radius around itself. All allied Starships of Gargantuan size or smaller within that area gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and increase their damage dice by one step (For example, from 4d10x2 to 4d12x2).
