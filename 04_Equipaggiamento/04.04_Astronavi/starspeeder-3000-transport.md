*Homebrew Reference Book:Â [Saga Edition All-Purpose Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Edition_All-Purpose_Sourcebook)*

The StarSpeeder-3000 is a small freighter used by many transport companies throughout the galaxy, mainly for passenger transport. Some transporters don't like it due to its odd shape, resembling a long box. This is merely an aesthetics question because it could be a pretty good ship for trading. It has a better than average [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) which gives it a head start over other vessels with a similar purpose. 

It excels even at sublight speeds and it can go toe to toe with any fighter when it comes to maneuverability. Also, cargo space should be enough for a small scale independent captain. On the other hand, it is poorly armoured and has fairly weak shields, making it vulnerable to attacks, so it is not meant to be used in the more dangerous systems. So, although it could be used as a trading ship, the StarSpeeder-3000 is really designed for routine safe journeys, such as passengers traveling between two systems or tourism. It doesn't even need a pilot. With the optional aid of an Astromech Droid who fits in its own socket on top of the ship, it can be piloted by the dependable [RX-Series Pilot Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/RX-Series_Pilot_Droid). 

The production companies responsible for the RX-Series gave the older but proven RX an overhaul to fit snugly in the cockpit, leaving as much room as possible for the passengers. Its personality makes sure they have an enjoyable time but when it comes to flying, the RX means serious business. Models adapted especially for passenger transport have features such as seats with extra padding and incorporated holo-viewers so they can watch the latest shows or follow up on the stock markets. There is even a basic dispenser of food and beverages suiting the taste of the majority of sentients but it is not designed for the more demanding passengers. Although comfortable, the StarSpeeder-3000 lacks the luxury or the streamlines of other ships.
