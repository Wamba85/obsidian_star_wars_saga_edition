*The *Nova Eclipse* Starship data created by Sterling Hershey ([source](https://www.sterlinghershey.com/blog/2012/5/9/star-wars-wednesday-nova-eclipse.html)).*

The *Nova Eclipse* is a highly customized and refitted [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/ar-37-paragon-class-light-transport.md|AR-37 *Paragon*-Class Light Transport]]. The current captain of The *Nova Eclipse* (a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] woman named [Jenara Faine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jenara_Faine)) has added a [Concussion Missile Launcher](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion_Missile_Launcher) to the dorsal turret, with a 6-missile payload. Also, that turret has been modified to be detachable, with a self-contained life support package and maneuvering thrusters to serve as a mini lifeboat- though it lacks any planetary reentry capability.

The ship's armor has been reinforced in places, and the shields have been substantially upgraded. The *Eclipse* also has a backup power generator mounted in the ceiling, rigged to key systems through conduits running along the outer hull of the ship. These are prone to disruption from hull damage and very attractive to [Mynocks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mynocks)- but when it works, the backup system is quite a lifesaver.

The *Nova Eclipse* also has a pair of hidden [Smuggler's Compartments](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smuggler's_Compartments) created by the restructuring of the ship. One is adjacent to the cargo bay, in a former auxiliary bay redesigned to open towards the cargo module. It's all but invisible to inspection because most AR-37 cargo pods don't even have an opening there. The other smuggling area is in an add-on junction box adjacent to the roof-mounted auxiliary power generator; it is reached through a ceiling vent in the main deck corridor, and can, itself, be vented into space in an emergency.

Which brings up, perhaps, The *Nova Eclipse's* most unusual customization: a network of bulky ventilation ducts half-recessed into the hull surface. These were added to allow the ship to maintain separate atmospheric controls in different compartments, with variable pressures and atmosphere composition for different species. Though this was probably installed for the comfort of a previous crew member accustomed to a low-oxygen environment, it has the added advantage of enabling the ship's atmosphere to be vented into the vacuum of space, in whole or in part, in a matter of moments- and re-pressurized almost as quickly. The ducts are spacious enough for a small creature to move about comfortably, or a Medium creature to crawl along. By disabling (or completely opening) the network of pressure seals, an occupant can even use the ducts to move about though the ship.

The stock AR-37 Transport is not a stylish or streamlined ship, and The *Nova Eclipse* even less so, but it's a solid and often-underestimated workhorse of galactic transportation. It can be operated under normal circumstances by a piloting crew of four, or even handled in a limited capacity by just a [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) and [Engineer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Engineer), but the ship works best with a team of 6: one [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)), a [Copilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Copilot), an [Engineer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Engineer), a [System Operator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/System_Operator), and two [Gunners](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunners).
