The YT-1250 is an upgrade of the YT-1200 and YT-1210, an unusual move on the part of Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC), which normally leaves all upgrades and modifications in the hands of those who purchase their Starships. However, when the [YT-1300](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/YT-1300) came out and became the best-selling small freighter CEC had ever produced, sales of existing YT-1200 series freighters plummeted. Stuck with a huge back stock they had expected to be able to sell at like-new prices, CEC took drastic measures to redesign the older ships and remarket them as a "New" product.

The YT-1250s have 20% less cargo capacity than a stock YT-1210. It makes up for this with more powerful engines, heavier weapons, and a basic set of defensive shields. (It also has only six [Emplacement Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emplacement_Points) free, as opposed to the 10 available in most YT-Series freighters.) CEC presented the sturdier ships as appropriate for light defense duties, cargo duties in more hazardous regions of space, and as armed merchant ships able to protect freighter convoys. Although sales remained sluggish, especially given the ship's increased cost and reduced cargo room, CEC was eventually able to sell them all to small, peaceful systems and militant trade guilds (such as the Trade Federation).

Though never as numerous as the YT-1300s that replaced them, the YT1250s are more durable, and thus more likely to remain active well into the Galactic Civil War and years beyond. They are popular with smugglers, pirates, couriers, and even a few bounty hunters. Like other CEC light freighters, most have been even more heavily modified by their owners over the decades, eventually bearing little resemblance to their "Stock" origins.
