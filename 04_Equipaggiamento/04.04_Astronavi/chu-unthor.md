*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

Although the Jedi Temple on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) is easily the largest and most famous Jedi training facility, the Order does train students in other locations. *Chu'unthor* is one such place. However, it's not a planet or temple, but an enormous ship designed by [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) both as a mobile training facility and as a symbol of the Republic's long reach and goodwill toward its citizens. A veritable army of engineers and shipbuilders from the Republic Fleet Systems built *Chu'unthor* (an old [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/cerean.md|Cerean]] word, meaning "Academy") four hundred years before the Clone Wars.

*Chu'unthor* serves [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) for nearly three hundred years until a series of catastrophic malfunctions forces the ship to crash land on the hostile planet of [Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir), home of a mysterious group known as [The Witches of Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witches_of_Dathomir). Although unable to fly again, the ship holds untold secrets and information about [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) and [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order). Recovery of this precious history helped [Luke Skywalker](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker,_Jedi_Master) create the foundation for his New Jedi Order.

### *Chu'unthor* Locations
*Chu'unthor* is a massive ship that dwarfs even the *[Imperial I](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyers)*[-Class Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyers) and *[Victory I](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyers)*[-Class Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_I-Class_Star_Destroyers) of the Empire. The ship is divided into three primary sections corresponding to the ship's primary missions of learning, teaching, and scholarship. Shaped like a lopsided "Y," *Chu'unthor* has an unusual design, mainly because it was considerably larger than most vessels of the era. As befitting its mission of peace, knowledge, and training, *Chu'unthor* does not sport any weapons beyond two [Batteries](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Batteries) of [Tractor Beams](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tractor_Beams).

The forward section of the ship is known as the Instruction Wing. The front of the vessel sprouts hundreds of sensors, arrays, communication clusters, and observation decks. Many of the ship's scientists and researchers are found here, studying new worlds and stellar phenomena. Two massive wings, known respectively as the Port Training Wing and the Starboard Training Wing, contain all of the classrooms, sparring rooms, meditation chambers, and dormitories required for the students.

The central hull holds the Hospital Wing and the primary archives. The Hospital Wing is large, well appointed, and capable of handling thousands of patients from a variety of [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) at a time. [Jedi Healers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Healers), as well as [MedCorps Workers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/MedCorps_Workers) (a branch of the Jedi Service Corps) train here. The medical facilities on board *Chu'unthor* are superb and on par with the infirmary at the Jedi Temple on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant). Numerous libraries and archive rooms are scattered throughout the central hull, holding a vast repository of Jedi teachings, as well as information about the sciences, arts, history, and literature of a thousand different [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) and cultures.

The rear of the ship contains the ship's enormous ion engines and Hyperspace drives, plus numerous docking clamps and bays. *Chu'unthor* is large enough to dock with up to ten Colossal (Frigate) vessels at a given time. This design allows *Chu'unthor* to receive a constant stream of supplies from support ships.

### *Chu'unthor* Inhabitants
For such a large ship, *Chu'unthor* has a relatively small crew and relies heavily on automation and Droids. Most of the crew are veterans of the Republic Navy. Jedi with an eye toward mechanics and technology often request assignment on *Chu'unthor* to help keep its engines in repair and to learn from its elegant, if obsolete, design.

*Chu'unthor* also carries a huge contingent of scientists, researchers, librarians, and other scholars, most of whom are not affiliated with [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order). The University of Sanbra, for example, established a "Branch Campus" aboard *Chu'unthor*, allowing tremendous advancements to occur in the fields of xenobiology and xenoscientology.

### *Chu'unthor* Adventure Hooks
*Chu'unthor* is large enough to serve as the hub for an entire campaign. Here are some ways to incorporate *Chu'unthor* into a home campaign:

- During what should have been a routine training exercise, one of *Chu'unthor*<nowiki/>'s new students is found dead inside a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) sparring room. It's soon discovered that the unthinkable has occurred: murder. The student, a headstrong Rodian with a chip on his shoulder, was generally disliked by the student body, but who, especially Jedi, would take this to such an extreme end?
- While a section of the Starboard Instructional Wing is refitted, the crew discovers several secret passageways. One such passageway leads to a hidden meditation chamber. A [Holocron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Holocron) sits upon a pedestal in the middle of the chamber, holding the spirit of a Jedi Master whose existence had been long forgotten.
- If the campaign is set in the time of [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era), the heroes are sent to [Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir) to help [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) recover some of the archives that have been sitting inside the downed *Chu'unthor* for decades. Although the heroes are allowed freedom to explore the ship by [The Witches of Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witches_of_Dathomir), the ship has become infested with the dangerous flora and fauna of the planet.
