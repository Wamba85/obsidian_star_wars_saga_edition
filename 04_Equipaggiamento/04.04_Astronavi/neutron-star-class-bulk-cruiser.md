Bulk cruisers were designed during the Clone Wars to serve as second-line warships. Produced with older technology and off-the-rack components, these Starship designs are all slow, undergunned, crew-intensive, and prone to malfunctions. In fact they are generally little more than upscaled [Space Transports](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transports), with little of the armor plating, heavy shielding or massive weapons that make most [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship) designs effective.

As their name suggests, they were simply large Starships, depending on their bulk to overpower smaller vessels. In truth a bulk cruiser has approximately the same firepower as a smaller (And cheaper) frigate, though somewhat more ability to absorb damage. Where they can, the designs use their freely available space to good advantage, such as considerable carried craft and massive heavy quad lasers (Which deal nearly as much damage as [Turbolasers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Turbolasers), but are much larger and cheaper to construct).

Rendili StarDrive's *Neutron Star*-Class Bulk Cruiser is typical of these designs. Produced during the Clone Wars, none of the ships see service in that conflict as the Separatists' sudden defeat catches Rendili off guard. The new Empire has very little interest in the outdated design (Though a few are bought for testing and patrol of already secure sectors), and the majority are sold to private concerns. For a few decades bulk cruisers are a common sight in poor systems and fringe worlds, but their poor performance and high maintenance costs puts most of the production line out of commission within three decades. Those few that remain are considered very second-rate vessels, and are mostly used as armed cargo transports.

### Tactical Fire
A *Neutron Star*-Class needs escorts, and normally depends on its own [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) complement to keep it safe. Its crews are taught to work with [Starfighter Wings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter_Wings) to protect them and get them safely on board the Bulk Cruiser when damaged. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a *Neutron Star*-Class Bulk Cruiser can forgo all attacks to provide [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) to all squares in a 2-square radius. All allied Starships of Gargantuan size or smaller within this radius gain a +2 bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense).
