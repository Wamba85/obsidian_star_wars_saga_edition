*Homebrew Reference Book:Â [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Vehicles and Vessels*

The Medical Cruiser is a common modification to the [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/consular-class-cruiser.md|*Consular*-Class Cruiser]]. A simple salon pod swap out with no modifications made to the standard ship at all, the *Consular*-Class Medical Cruiser is a common sight around disaster zones the galaxy over. While only a few of these were a part of Ranulph Tarkin's armada during the Stark Hyperspace War, they were used much more extensively by the Refugee Relief Movement during the early stages of the Separatist Crisis.

The ship also sees widespread use during the Clone Wars in areas where a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.04_Astronavi/medstar-class-frigate.md|*MedStar*-Class Frigate]] is unavailable. It's common for the Refugee Relief Movement to send one of its many cruisers to a disaster zone and launch its salon pod to a landing site.

This allows the craft to return to base to pick up another pod, while the salon pod was able to set up shop exactly where it was needed. The salon pod included rooms for staff and supplies enough to work at most sites for up to six months without resupply.

### Capabilities
The *Consular*-Class Medical Cruiser possess 150 medical beds, 15 bacta tanks, and a medical staff of 20 with 40 Medical Droids all within the salon pod. Should the salon pod be ejected, the cruiser itself would lose 25 SR, which would remain with the pod.
