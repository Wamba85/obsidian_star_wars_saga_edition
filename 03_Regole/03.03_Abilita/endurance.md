**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)**

You can push yourself beyond your normal physical limits.

### Forced March
Each hour of walking after 8 hours requires you to attempt a DC 10 Endurance check (+2 per hour after the first). If you fail, you move -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). You can only remove this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) by resting for 8 hours.

### Hold Breath
You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to your [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) score. After this period of time, you must succeed on a DC 10 Endurance check to continue holding your breath. The DC increases by +2 per additional round. If you fail, you must breath or you move -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). If you reach the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), you fall unconscious. If you are still unable to breath on your next turn after falling unconscious, you die.

### Ignore Hunger
You can go without food for a number of days equal to your [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier (minimum 1 day). After this time, you must succeed on a Endurance check each day or move -1 step [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). You can only remove this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) by eating a nutritious meal. The DC is 10 on the first day and increases by +2 each day thereafter.

### Ignore Thirst
You can go without water for a number of hours equal to three times your [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) score. After this time, you must succeed on an Endurance check each day or move -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). You may only remove this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) by drinking at least 1 liter of water; for creatures that are not Medium sized, multiply the water required by 10 for every size category above Medium or divide it by 10 for every size category below Medium. The DC is 10 on the first day and increases by +2 each day thereafter.

### Run
You can [Run](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Run) as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). When you Run, you can move up to four times your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) in a straight line (or three times your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) in a straight line if you are wearing [Heavy Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Armor) or carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load)).

You lose any [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) while you're Running, since you can't actively avoid attacks. You can run for a number of rounds equal to your [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) score without any trouble. If you want to continue Running after that, you must succeed on a DC 10 Endurance check.

You must check again each round in which you continue to Run, and the DC of the Endurance check increases by 1 for each previous check you made.

When you fail a check, you move -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). You can only remove this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) by resting for the same length of time that you were Running. During this rest period, you can only [Move](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move) at your normal [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed).
### Sleep in Armor
You can sleep while wearing Armor by succeeding at an Endurance check. If you fail, you don't sleep and move -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). You can only remove this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) by sleeping for 8 hours.

| ARMOR TYPE |  | DC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Light Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Armor) |  | 10 |
| [Medium Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medium_Armor) |  | 15 |
| [Heavy Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Armor) |  | 20 |

### Swim/Tread Water
Each hour that you swim, you must succeed on a DC 15 Endurance check or move -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). You can only remove this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) by resting (not swimming or treading water) for the same length of time that you were swimming. Each consecutive hour of swimming increases the DC by +2. If you are only treading water, reduce the DC by 5.
