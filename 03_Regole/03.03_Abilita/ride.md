**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)***

**The [Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty) applies only when attempting to Fast Mount or Fast Dismount.*

Use this skill to ride any kind of mount, such as a [Tauntaun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tauntaun), [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/dewback.md|Dewback]], or [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.03_Veicoli/bantha.md|Bantha]].

**Special:** You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) when making a Ride check, but you can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20).

**Time:** Ride is a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), except when otherwise noted for the special tasks listed above.

### Ride Mount
Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount without a problem. Mounting or dismounting an animal is a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

Some tasks, such as those undertaken in combat or other extreme circumstances, require checks. In addition, attempting trick riding or convincing the animal to do something unusual also requires a check.

| RIDING TASK | DC |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Guide with Knees | 10 | Leap | 15 |  |
| Stay in Saddle | 10 | Control Mount in Battle | 20 |  |
| Cover | 15 | Fast Mount or Dismount | 20* |  |
| Soft Fall | 15 |  |  |  |

**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty) applies.*

### Control Mount in Battle
As a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you can attempt to control a [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount) while in combat. If you fail, you can do nothing else that round. You do not need to roll for riding animals specifically trained for battle.

### Fast Mount or Dismount
You can Mount or Dismount as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). If you fail the check, Mounting or Dismounting is a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

You can't attempt a Fast Mount or Dismount unless you can perform the Mount or Dismount as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) this round, should the check fail.

### Guide with Knees
You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat or to perform some other action. Make the check at the start of your turn.

If you fail, you can only use one hand this round because you need the other to control your [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount).

### Leap
You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride skill modifier or the Mount's [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/jump.md|Jump]] skill modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount) can jump.

A DC 15 Ride check is required to stay on the [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount) when it leaps.

### Soft Fall
You react instantly when you fall off a [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount), such as when it is killed or when it falls, to avoid taking damage. If you fail, you take 1d6 points of [Falling Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Damage).

### Stay in Saddle
You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage.

### Use Mount as Cover
As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to an attack against you, you can drop down and hang alongside your [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount), using it as one-half [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover). If you fail, you don't get the [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) benefit.
