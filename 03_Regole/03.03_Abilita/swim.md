**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)**

Using this skill, a land-based creature can swim, dive, navigate underwater obstacles, and so on.

**Special:** You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) when making a Swim check, but you can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20).

**Retry:** A new check is allowed the round after a check is failed.

### Swim
A successful Swim check allows you to swim one-quarter your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) or one-half your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). Roll once per round.

If you fail, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater and must hold your breath with an [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/endurance.md|Endurance]] check until you can reach the surface by succeeding on a Swim check.

The DC for the Swim check depends on the situation:

| SITUATION |  | DC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Calm Water |  | 10 |
| Rough Water |  | 15 |
| Stormy Water |  | 20 |
