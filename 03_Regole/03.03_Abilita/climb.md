**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)**

Use this skill to scale a cliff, to get to a window on the second story of a building, or to climb up an antenna array after falling out of an airway at the bottom of a floating city.

**Special:** Someone using a rope can haul a character upward (or lower the character) by means or sheer strength. Use the [Encumbrance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Encumbrance) rules to determine how much weight a character can lift. You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) when Climbing, but you can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20).

### Climb Surface
With each successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds). A slope is considered to be any incline of less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline of 60 degrees or steeper. You can climb at one-half of your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). You can move half that far- one-fourth of your Speed- as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

A failed Climb check indicates that you made no progress, and a check that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained. The DC of the check depends on the circumstances of the climb:

| DC |  | EXAMPLE WALL OR SURFACE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 |  | Slope too steep to walk up; knotted rope with a wall to brace against. |
| 5 |  | Rope with a wall to brace against or a knotted rope, but not both. |
| 10 |  | Surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall. |
| 15 |  | Surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree; or an unknotted rope. |
| 20 |  | Uneven surface with narrow handholds and footholds. |
| 25 |  | Rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall. |
| 25 |  | Overhanging or ceiling with handholds but no footholds. |
| <nowiki>-</nowiki> |  | Perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface cannot be climbed. |
| <nowiki>-10*</nowiki> |  | Climbing inside an air duct or other location where one can brace against two opposite walls (reduces normal DC by 10). |
| <nowiki>-5*</nowiki> |  | Climbing a corner where you can brace against perpendicular walls (reduces normal DC by 5). |
| <nowiki>+5*</nowiki> |  | Surface is slippery (increase normal DC by 5). |

**These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.*

Since you can't move to avoid an attack while climbing, opponents get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against you, and you lose any [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate [Falling Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Damage).

### Accelerated Climbing
You can try to Climb more quickly than normal, but you take a -5 penalty on Climb checks. Accelerated Climbing allows you to Climb at your full [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). You can move half that far- one-half of your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed)- as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

### Catching Yourself When Falling
It's practically impossible to catch yourself while falling. Make a Climb check (DC # wall's DC + 20) to do so. A slope is relatively easier to catch yourself on (DC slope's DC + 10).

### Making Handholds and Footholds
You can make your own handholds and footholds by ponding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per meter. As with any surface with handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with an ice axe or similar implement can cut handholds or footholds in an ice wall.

## Additional Climb Applications
The following applications of the Climb skill are compiled from the subsequent [Reference Books](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reference_Books) released for *Saga Edition*:

### Climbing in Low or High Gravity
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

When climbing in [Low Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Low_Gravity) environments, Climb DCs are halved and movement is doubled. When climbing in [High Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/High_Gravity) environments, DCs are doubled and Climb Speed is halved (minimum 1 square).

### Extreme Conditions
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

Climbing in extreme conditions (high altitude, weather, temperature, or unusual climbing surfaces) brings additional challenges. Proper climbing and survival gear is required. Extreme conditions can increase the DC by 5 for each circumstance in addition to the regular DC modifiers. Specialized climbing gear can negate these penalties to Climb checks under those conditions; typically, such gear costs the same as a [Field Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Field_Kit).
