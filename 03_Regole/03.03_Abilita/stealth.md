**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)**

Use this skill to slink past a sentry without being heard, catch your enemy off-guard, snipe from a concealed location, or perform sleight of hand.

**Special:** You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) when making a Stealth check, but you can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20).

### Sneak
Your Stealth check sets the DC for [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] checks made to notice you. If an opponent's [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check equals or exceeds your Stealth check, your opponent notices you.

Any circumstance that hampers your ability to sneak imposes a -2 penalty on your check, while favorable circumstances grant a +2 bonus. For example, sneaking across a surface littered with debris imposes a -2 penalty on your Stealth check, while a room filled with abundant hiding places grants a +2 bonus on your check.

If you move more than your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) in any given round, you take a -5 penalty on your Stealth check. If you move more than twice your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) in any given round, you take a -10 penalty on your Stealth check.

Your size provides a modifier to your Stealth checks:

| SIZE | MODIFIER |  | SIZE | MODIFIER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fine | <nowiki>+20</nowiki> | Large | <nowiki>-5</nowiki> |  |
| Diminutive | <nowiki>+15</nowiki> | Huge | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> |  |
| Tiny | <nowiki>+10</nowiki> | Gargantuan | <nowiki>-15</nowiki> |  |
| Small | <nowiki>+5</nowiki> | Colossal | <nowiki>-20</nowiki> |  |
| Medium | <nowiki>+0</nowiki> |  |  |  |

### Conceal Item
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can attempt to conceal an item (such as a weapon) on your person. The concealed object must be at least one size smaller than you, and you get a modifier on your skill check based on the object's relative size:

| RELATIVE SIZE TO CHARACTER |  | MODIFIER |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One size smaller |  | -5 |
| Two sizes smaller |  | +0 |
| Three sizes smaller |  | +5 |
| Four or more sizes smaller |  | +10 |

Other characters may notice a concealed object with a successful [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check (opposed by your Stealth check result), but only if you do not have [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment).

A character gains a +10 circumstance bonus on their [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check if they are physically touching you to search for concealed items; this requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) that can only be performed if you are a willing, [Pinned](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pinned), or [Helpless](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Helpless) target.

Drawing a Concealed Item is a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action).

### Create a Diversion to Hide
You can use the [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/deception.md|Deception]] skill to help you be stealthy. A successful [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/deception.md|Deception]] check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check even though people are aware of you.

While the others turn their attention from you, you can make a Stealth check (as normal, with no penalty) if you can reach a hiding place of some kind as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

### Pick Pocket
With a successful Stealth check as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can pilfer a small, hand-sized object from a target within reach. Your Stealth check is opposed by the target's [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check, and the target gains a +5 bonus.

If you fail by 4 or less, you are unable to take the item, but the target does not notice the effort. If you fail by 5 or more, you are unable to take the item and the target catches you in the act.

### Sleight of Hand
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can palm hand-sized objects, perform minor feats of legerdemain, or attempt to perform a minor action without being noticed (such as flipping a switch, pulling out a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/thermal-detonator.md|Thermal Detonator]], or drawing a pistol under the cover of a table).

All such efforts are opposed by observers' [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check. Any observer that beats your Stealth check notices the action you attempted, and knows how you did it.

### Snipe
After making a ranged attack from hiding, you can try to hide again. You must be at least 2 squares from the target, and you must have already have successfully used Stealth to hide from the target.

Make a new Stealth check (as normal, but with a -10 penalty) as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action). If you succeed, you remain hidden; otherwise, your location is revealed.

## Additional Stealth Applications
The following applications of the Stealth skill are compiled from the subsequent [Reference Books](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reference_Books) released for *Saga Edition*:

### Conceal Large Items
*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can attempt to conceal or hide a large item inside a room, behind a piece of furniture, inside a hidden compartment, or within a shipboard locker or other location. A large item is one that is one that is the same size category as you or larger.

Other characters can [Notice](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Notice) a concealed object or, if the item has [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment), discover a telltale sign that something is amiss (such as unusual scratches, fibers, or smells) by making a successful [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check (opposed by your Stealth check result).

A character gains a +10 circumstance bonus to their [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check if they are in the same square as the item or an adjacent square. Rooms or containers specifically constructed to conceal items can grant an [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus of +5 to +20 (for features such as top-of-the-line [Smuggler's Compartments](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Smuggler's_Compartments)) on your Stealth check.

You may not [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on this check, but you may [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10).

### Drop
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

You can use Stealth to deposit a small concealed item without attracting notice, such as slipping a drug into a drink or planting a bug on a person's clothes. Any observer that beats your Stealth check with a [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check notices the Drop.
