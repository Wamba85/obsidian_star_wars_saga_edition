**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)**

You can move at normal speed across [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain), keep your balance while walking on a narrow surface, take less damage from a fall, slip free of restraints or [Grappling](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grappling) a foe, and get up from [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) safely. In addition to the specific options listed below, you can use Acrobatics to perform typical tumbling, flipping, or gymnastic maneuvers.

**Special:** You can't [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) or [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on an Acrobatics check. If you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in Acrobatics, you gain a +5 dodge bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) when [Fighting Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Defensively).

### Balance
A successful Acrobatics check allows you to move at half speed along a narrow surface such as a ledge or wire. The DC of the Acrobatics check varies with the width of the surface (see below). If the surface is slippery or unstable, increase the DC by 5. A failed check means you fall [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) and must make a DC 15 Acrobatics check to catch the ledge or wire. You are considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) while balancing, and thus you lose your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (if any).

If you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in Acrobatics, you aren't considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) while Balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must immediately make another Acrobatics check against the same DC to keep from falling.

| NARROW SURFACE |  | ACROBATICS DC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8-15 cm wide |  | 10 |
| 4-7 cm wide |  | 15 |
| Less than 4 cm wide |  | 20 |

### Cross Difficult Terrain (Trained Only)
With a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check, you can move through [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) at your normal [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed).

### Escape Bonds
With a successful Acrobatics check, you can slip free of restraints (DC varies, see below), wiggle through a tight space (DC 20), or escape from a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) (DC = the grappler's [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check). The DC to slip free of a restraint depends on the type of restraint (see below). It takes a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to escape a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple). It takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to escape a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/net.md|Net]] or to move 1 square through a tight space. It takes 1 minute to escape from ropes, binder cuffs, or manacles.

| RESTRAINT |  | ACROBATICS DC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ropes |  | Opponent's [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) check + 10 |
| [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/net.md|Net]] |  | 15 |
| [Binder Cuffs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binder_Cuffs) |  | 25 |

### Fall Prone (Trained Only)
If you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in Acrobatics and succeed at a DC 15 check, you can drop to a [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) position as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) (instead of a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action)).

### Reduce Falling Damage (Trained Only)
With a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check, you can treat a fall as if it was 3 meters (2 squares) shorter when determining [Falling Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Damage). For every 10 points by which you beat this DC, you can subtract an additional 3 meters from the fall for determining damage. If you make this check and take no damage from the fall, you land on your feet.

If you are struck by a falling object, you can reduce the damage you take by half with a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check (see [Falling Objects](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Objects)).

When falling great distances, you can attempt to use your Acrobatics skill to guide your decent. Make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to land on a target near a square you would normally land in. You can adjust your target by 1 square for every 60 meters (40 squares) fallen. Gamemasters can give favorable or unfavorable circumstance adjustments to the check based on mitigating circumstances- for example, the amount of wind or the favorable use of [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment), such as baggy clothing.

### Stand up from Prone (Trained Only)
If you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in Acrobatics and succeed a DC 15 check, you can stand up from a [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) position as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) (instead of a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action)).

### Tumble (Trained Only)
If you succeed a DC 15 Acrobatics check, you can Tumble through the [Threatened Area](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Threatened_Area) or [Fighting Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Space) of an enemy as part of your [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) without provoking an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity). Each threatened or occupied square that you Tumble through counts as 2 squares of movement.

## Additional Acrobatics Applications
The following applications of the Acrobatics skill are compiled from the subsequent [Reference Books](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reference_Books) released forÂ *Saga Edition*:

### Catch Item (Trained Only)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

Whenever you successfully [Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm) your opponent, you can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). If the Acrobatics check succeeds, you snatch the object from the air. You must have at least one hand free to grab the item.

### Escape Artist (Trained Only)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

By increasing the DC by 10, you can reduce the time required to Escape Bonds (see above). Escaping a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) takes a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action); escaping a [[04_Equipaggiamento/04.01_Armi/net.md|Net]] or moving 1 square through a tight space requires a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action); and only 5 rounds are required to escape from ropes, binder cuffs, or manacles.

### Low or High Gravity Environments (Trained Only)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

You can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to negate the penalties to attack rolls in [Low Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Low_Gravity) and [High Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/High_Gravity) environments.

### Nimble Charge (Trained Only)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

If you succeed on a DC 25 Acrobatics check, you can [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) through [Low Objects](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Low_Objects) and [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain). If you fail this check, you cannot attack at the end of your movement. You can combine this with the Cross Difficult Terrain action (see above); however, the DC increases to 35.

### Zero-Gravity Environments (Trained Only)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

You can use the Acrobatics skill to help maneuver in [Zero-Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zero-Gravity) environments. When crossing wide spaces or traversing congested areas, you can make an Acrobatics check (at no penalty) to arrive on target. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to lessen your attack roll and skill check penalty to -2 (instead of the normal -5).
