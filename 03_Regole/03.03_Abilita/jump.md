**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)**

Use this skill to leap over pits, vault low fences, or jump down from a tree's lowest branches.

**Special:** You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) when making a Jump check. If there is no danger associated with falling, you can [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20). Distance covered by a Long Jump or High Jump counts against your maximum movement in a round; distance covered by Jumping Down does not.

### Long Jump
The DC of a running Long Jump is equal to the distance cleared (in meters) multiplied by 3. For example, clearing a 3-meter-wide (2-square-wide) pit requires a successful DC 9 Jump check. If you do not get at least a 4-square running start, the DC is doubled.

### High Jump
The DC of a running High Jump is equal to the distance cleared (in meters) multiplied by 12. For example, landing atop a 1.5-meter-high (1-square-high) ledge requires a successful DC 18 Jump check. If you use a pole of sufficient height to help you vault the distance, the DC is halved. If you do not get at least a 4-square running start, the DC is doubled.

### Jump Down
If you intentionally Jump Down from a height, you can attempt a DC 15 Jump check to treat [Falling Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Damage) as if you had dropped 3 meters (2 squares) fewer than you actually did. For every 10 points by which you beat the DC, you can subtract an additional 3 meters (2 squares) from the fall when determining damage. If you succeed on this check and take no damage, you land on your feet.
