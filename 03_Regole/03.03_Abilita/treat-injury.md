*See also: [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills)*

Use this skill to keep a badly wounded friend from dying, to heal the injured, or to treat a diseased or poisoned character.

**Special:** You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) when making a Treat Injury check, but you can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20).

### First Aid (Requires [Medpac](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medpac))
As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can administer First Aid to an [Unconscious](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unconscious) or wounded creature. If you succeed on a DC 15 Treat Injury check, the creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to its Character Level, +1 for every point by which your check exceeds the DC. Using a [Medical Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_Kit) grants a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on your skill check.

If the skill check succeeds, the tended creature cannot benefit from additional First Aid for 24 hours. You can administer First Aid on yourself, but you take a -5 penalty on your Treat Injury check.

### Long-Term Care
If you tend to a creature for 8 consecutive hours, that creature regains hit points equal to its Character Level in addition to those recovered from [Natural Healing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Natural_Healing). A creature can only benefit from Long-Term Care once in a 24-hour period. You can tend one creature at a time if [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained), or up to six simultaneously if [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained). You can't give Long-Term Care to yourself.

### Perform Surgery (Trained Only; Requires [Surgery Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surgery_Kit))
You can perform surgery to heal damage to a wounded creature, remove a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition), or install a [Cybernetic Prosthesis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cybernetic_Prosthesis). Any of these operations require 1 hour of uninterrupted work, at the end of which time you must make a Treat Injury check. If you fail your check, the Surgery does not yield any benefit (but any resources used are still lost). In addition, if you fail your check by 5 or more, the creature takes damage equal to its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). If the damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies.

You can make a DC 20 Treat Injury check to perform surgery on a wounded creature, healing an amount of damage equal to the character's [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) bonus (minimum 1) x the creature's level.

If you fail the check, the creature instead takes damage equal to its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). If the creature was already at 0 Hit Points, it dies unless it can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to save itself.

You can perform Surgery on yourself to Heal Damage, but you take a -5 penalty on your skill check. Performing Surgery to Heal Damage also removes any [Persistent Conditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Conditions) afflicting the target.

You must have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/cybernetic-surgery.md|Cybernetic Surgery]] feat to install a [Cybernetic Prosthesis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cybernetic_Prosthesis) on a living being. At the end of the procedure, make a DC 20 Treat Injury check. If the check succeeds, the prosthesis is installed properly.

If the check fails, the prosthesis is not properly installed; however, you can try again after another uninterrupted hour of surgery. You can install a [Cybernetic Prosthesis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cybernetic_Prosthesis) on yourself, but you take a -5 penalty on your skill check.

### Revivify (Trained Only, Requires [Medical Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_Kit))
As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can revive a creature that has just died. You must reach the dead creature within 1 round of its death to revive it, and you must succeed on a DC 25 Treat Injury check. Using a [Medpac](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medpac) grants a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on the skill check.

If the check succeeds, the creature is [Unconscious](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unconscious) instead of dead. If the check fails, you are unable to revive the creature.

### Treat Disease (Trained Only; Requires [Medical Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_Kit))
Treating a diseased character requires 8 hours. At the end of that time, make a Treat Injury check against the [Disease's](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disease) DC. If the check succeeds, the patient is cured and no longer suffers any ill effects (including [Persistent Conditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Conditions) caused by the [Disease](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disease)).

You can treat one creature at a time if [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained), or up to six simultaneously if [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained).

### Treat Poison (Trained Only; Requires [Medical Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_Kit))
As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can treat a poisoned character. Make a Treat Injury check; if the result equals or exceeds the [Poison's](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) DC, you successfully detoxify the [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) in the character's system and the patient no longer suffers any ill effects (including [Persistent Conditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Conditions) caused by the [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison)).

### Treat Radiation (Trained Only; Requires [Medical Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medical_Kit))
Treating an irradiated character requires 8 hours. At the end of that time, make a Treat Injury check against the [Radiation's](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation) DC. If the check succeeds, the patient is cured and no longer suffers any ill effects (including [Persistent Conditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Conditions) caused by the [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation)).

You can treat one creature at a time if [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained), or up to six simultaneously if [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained).

## Additional Treat Injury Applications

### Temporary Mending (Trained Only)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You can make temporary repairs to any damaged or disabled [Biotech Device](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Biotech_Device) or [Living Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Living_Vehicle). Temporary mending requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) followed by a successful DC 20 Treat Injury check.

You take a -5 penalty on the check unless you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/biotech-specialist.md|Biotech Specialist]] feat. If you use a [Biotech Tool Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Biotech_Tool_Kit), you gain a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on the check.

A Temporarily Mended device moves +2 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) and heals 1d8 Hit Points. At the end of the encounter, the Temporarily Mended device moves -5 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) and is [Disabled](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disabled).

### Critical Care (Trained Only; Requires [Medpac](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medpac) and [Surgery Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surgery_Kit))
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Dawn of Defiance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Dawn_of_Defiance) ([The Gem of Alderaan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gem_of_Alderaan))*

You can attempt to use multiple [Medpacs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medpacs) on a creature in a 24-hour period. This requires one minute, and it expends the contents of one [Medpac](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medpac). If you succeed on a DC 20 Treat Injury check, the creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to its Character Level, plus 1 Hit Point for every point by which your check result exceeds the DC.

You take a -5 penalty to your Treat Injury check for every previous attempt at Critical Care in the last 24 hours, even if that attempt was unsuccessful.

If you fail on the Treat Injury check, the creature overdoses on the medicines in the [Medpac](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medpac), causing it to take damage equal to its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). If this would reduce the creature to 0 Hit Points, it dies unless it can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to save itself.

You can attempt to perform Critical Care on yourself, but you take a -5 penalty on your Treat Injury check.
