*See also: [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills), [Pilot (Vehicle Combat)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat))*

Use this skill to operate a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle). Basic operation of a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) does not require a skill check or special training, but performing evasive maneuvers and difficult stunts does. Whenever you make a Pilot check, you must apply the Vehicle's Size Modifier to your check (see Vehicle Sizes, below).

| VEHICLE SIZE | SIZE MODIFIER |  | VEHICLE SIZE | SIZE MODIFIER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Colossal (Station) | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> | Gargantuan | <nowiki>-5</nowiki> |  |
| Colossal (Cruiser) | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> | Huge | <nowiki>-2</nowiki> |  |
| Colossal (Frigate) | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> | Large | <nowiki>-1</nowiki> |  |
| Colossal | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> |  |  |  |

**Special: **You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) when making a Pilot check except when attempting to Increase Vehicle Speed. You can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on a Pilot check.

### Engage the Enemy (Trained Only)
When [Piloting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Piloting) a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) in combat, you can choose to make a Pilot check instead of an [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/initiative.md|Initiative]] check to determine your place in the [Initiative Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative_Order).

### Increase Vehicle Speed (Trained Only)
You may make a DC 20 Pilot check as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to make your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) perform beyond its normal limits. (You can't [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on this check.) If this check fails, your Vehicle's Speed does not increase, and your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) moves -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

If you succeed, your Vehicle's Speed increases by 1 square until the start of your next turn. For every 5 points by which you exceed the DC, your Vehicle's Speed increases by an additional 1 square.

## Additional Pilot Applications
The following applications of the Pilot skill are compiled from the subsequent [Reference Books](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reference_Books) released for *Saga Edition*:

### Fly Casual (Trained Only)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

Whenever you are [Piloting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Piloting) a Starship or other [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), you can substitute a Pilot check for a [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/deception.md|Deception]] check to give off a [Deceptive Appearance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deceptive_Appearance). You still might be required to produce documentation and know specific procedures as is customary for the situation, but this use helps you avert suspicion in the first place, especially when your authorization codes are old and out of date.

### Starship Stealth
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

If you are the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)), you can use [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) to [Sneak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak) in a Starship just as you do normally. Add your Vehicle's Size Modifier (see below) and [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) modifier to your Stealth check, and take a -5 penalty if you are not [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the Pilot skill.

The [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check result sets the DC of a [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check to locate you with sensors or the [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/perception.md|Perception]] check DC to [Notice](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Notice) you with normal senses (normally impossible at [Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale), but not when you try to hide your Starship in a swamp or the back of a hangar).

| SIZE | MODIFIER |  | SIZE | MODIFIER |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Large | <nowiki>-5</nowiki> | Gargantuan | <nowiki>-15</nowiki> |  |
| Huge | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> | Colossal | <nowiki>-20</nowiki> |  |

Normally, you can only perform Starship Stealth check if you have [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) or [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) (for example, from asteroids, other Starships, or even clouds in the upper atmosphere). You can even attempt to hide against the hull of an enemy Starship that is at least two sizes larger than your Vehicle, provided that you [Create a Diversion to Hide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Create_a_Diversion_to_Hide) (see [Starship Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Deception)) and you can reach the enemy Starship with a single [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

(Han Solo uses this trick to hide on the Star Destroyer *Avenger* in *The Empire Strikes Back*.)
