**[Armor Check Penalty](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Check_Penalty)**

Use this skill to gain an advantage in combat.

**Special:** You can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on an Initiative check, but you can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20).

### Start Battle
An Initiative check sets the order of combat when a fight starts. Each character aware of the fight makes an Initiative check and goes in order from highest to lowest. When [Piloting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Piloting) a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) in combat, you must apply the Vehicle's size modifier to your Initiative check (see below).

| VEHICLE SIZE |  | SIZE MODIFIER |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Colossal (Station) |  | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> |
| Colossal (Cruiser) |  | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> |
| Colossal (Frigate) |  | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> |
| Colossal |  | <nowiki>-10</nowiki> |
| Gargantuan |  | <nowiki>-5</nowiki> |
| Huge |  | <nowiki>-2</nowiki> |
| Large |  | <nowiki>-1</nowiki> |

### Avoid Feint
When an opponent attempts to [Feint](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feint) in combat, you oppose their [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/deception.md|Deception]] check with an Initiative check. If you meet or beat their [[03_Regole/03.03_Abilita/deception.md|Deception]] check result, their [Feint](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feint) result fails.

## Additional Initiative Applications
The following applications of the Initiative skill are compiled from the subsequent reference books released forÂ *Saga Edition*:

### Saber Lock (Requires **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)**)
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

Many times two [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) combatants will strike at one another, locking their [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers) together in a test of strength and skill as their blades crackle with contact. As an optional rule, whenever a character with the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** Talent rolls their [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to negate the attack and the skill check result is exactly equal to the incoming attack roll, the attack is negated and a Saber Lock occurs.

Both characters lock their [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers) together, and both the original attacker and the blocking Jedi make an opposed [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check. The character with the higher result may make an immediate [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack against the other character as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), at which point the Saber Lock ends.
