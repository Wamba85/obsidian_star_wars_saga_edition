*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Jedi combine physical training with mastery of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Jedi concentrate on battle prowess, defense, and [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) training. Additionally, they are ambassadors of the Jedi order, protecting the Republic from all dangers. Few are strong enough in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), and have the devotion to walk the Jedi's path, but those few are awarded with a powerful ally. They walk in a larger world than those who neither feel nor heed [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).

### Adventurers
All Jedi journey into the galaxy at large to further their own knowledge and to help those in need. They take their responsibility seriously, considering even the mundane missions to be personal tests. Most Jedi follow [The Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Light_Side), but some become darksiders and use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) for evil or selfish intent. Those imbued with [The Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Light_Side) refrain from using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) for every task, preferring to find other solutions and save [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) for when it is truly needed. Those who succumb to [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) use every advantage at their disposal, wielding [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to solve problems as a soldier would use a blaster to destroy a [Stingfly](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stingfly).

### Characteristics
The Jedi's strength flows from [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), granting them special powers. This character often masters the ability to feel [The Living Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Living_Force) in the world within them. [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) are the most important abilities for a Jedi, although any of the other abilities are nearly as important.

### Backgrounds
A Jedi typically starts out as a Padawan learner attached to a [Jedi Master](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Master). (Prior to 1st level, the character trained as a student with the Jedi Council. They began their heroic career at 1st level when they are selected as a Padawan learner.) The Jedi has a genuine desire to use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to help the people of the galaxy. A Jedi has a deep connection to their mentor and the Jedi order, but often operates with only tangential contact with either their Master or order.

Still, not all who study the Jedi arts are actually members of the Jedi order. During the Old Sith Wars (thousands of years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin)), many Sith acolytes and initiates are often members of this class before becoming a [Sith Apprentice](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Apprentice) under a particular [Sith Lord](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord). This class is also common among other [Force Traditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Traditions) with strong ties to the Jedi arts, such as [The Jensaarai](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jensaarai).

## Building a Lightsaber
*Main Article: [Lightsaber Construction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Construction)*

You can build a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)) if you have at least seven Heroic Levels, as well as the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] and [Weapon Proficiency (Lightsabers)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Lightsabers)) Feats. You must spend 1500 credits to obtain the basic components, and 24 uninterrupted hours constructing the weapon. At the end of this time, make a DC 20 [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check; you can't [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on this check. If the check succeeds, you complete the Lightsaber's construction. If the check fails, you may spend another 24 hours dismantling and rebuilding the flawed weapon.

Once the [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)) is constructed, you may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to attune it (a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action)). From that point on, you gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls made with your Self-Built [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_(Weapon)). No one else who wields the weapon gains this bonus.

You can build any type of [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) you wish, but large sized [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers) (Such as a [Double-Bladed Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Double-Bladed_Lightsaber)) require a component cost of 3000 credits, and small sized [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers) (such as a [Short Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Short_Lightsaber)) require 1000 credits.
