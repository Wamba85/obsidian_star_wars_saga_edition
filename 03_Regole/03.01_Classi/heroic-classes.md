Five basic Classes, known as Heroic Classes, are available in the *Star Wars Roleplaying Game*. Characters with levels in Heroic Classes are called Heroic Characters, or Heroes. Unlike [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) supporting characters, Heroic Characters have many special  abilities that make them extraordinary.

At 1st level, you must choose a Heroic Class for your character. The five Heroic Classes are:
- **[[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/jedi.md|Jedi]]:** The Jedi are the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. They learn to master [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), and their trademark weapon is the [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber).
- **[[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/noble.md|Noble]]:** The Noble is a shrewd bargainer and negotiator who inspires confidence and makes a great leader.
- **[[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/scoundrel.md|Scoundrel]]:** The Scoundrel is a tricky, skillful rogue who succeeds by stealth instead of brute force.
- **[Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout):** The Scout is a cunning, skilled explorer trained to operate in the vast wilderness of space and backwater worlds.
- **[Soldier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier):** A warrior with exceptional combat capability and unequaled skill with weapons.

## Class and Level Bonuses
*Main Article: [Class Bonuses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class_Bonuses)*

An attack roll is a combination of three numbers, each representing a different factor: a random factor (the number you roll on the d20), a number representing the character's innate abilities (the [Ability](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ability) modifier), and a bonus representing the character's experience and training.

This third factor depends on the character's Class and Level. Each Class table (see Heroic Class' individual pages) summarizes the figures for this third factor.

## Level-Dependent Benefits
*Main Article: [Level Benefits](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Level_Benefits)*

The *Star Wars Roleplaying Game *uses the terms *Class Level* and *Character Level* to mean different things. Class Level pertains to a character's level in a particular Class. Character Level pertains to a character's total experience.

## Multiclass Characters
*Main Article: [Multiclassing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Multiclassing)*

As your character advances in level, he or she may add new classes. Adding a new Class gives the character a broader range of abilities, but all advancement in the new Class is at the expense of advancement in the character's other Class or Classes.
