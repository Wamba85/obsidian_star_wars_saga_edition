*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Soldiers combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the galaxy. Soldiers can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or brave adventurers. They can be hired guns, noble champions, or cold-hearted killers. They fight for glory, for honor, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or simply for the thrill of battle.

### Adventurers
Many Soldiers see adventures, raids on enemy strongholds, and dangerous missions as their jobs. Some want to defend those who can't defend themselves; others seek to use their muscle to carve their own place of importance in the galaxy. Whatever their initial motivation, most Soldiers wind up living for the thrill of combat and the excitement of adventure. Adventuring Soldiers call themselves guards, bodyguards, champions, enforcers, mercenaries, warriors, soldiers of fortune, or simple adventurers.

### Characteristics
Soldiers have the best all-around fighting abilities, and an individual Soldier develops styles and techniques that set him apart from their peers. A given Soldier might be especially capable with certain weapons, another trained to execute specific combat maneuvers. As Soldiers gain experience, they get more opportunities to develop their fighting skills.

### Backgrounds
Most Soldiers come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military organization, local militia, or private army. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A Soldier may have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life. Another may be following a proud family tradition. Soldiers in a particular unit share certain camaraderie, but most have nothing in common except battle prowess and the desire to apply it to a given situation.

#### **Examples of Soldiers in *Star Wars***
Admiral Ackbar, Corran Horn, Captain Panaka, Captain Typho, General Crix Madine, Kyle Katarn, Wedge Antilles, Zam Wesell
