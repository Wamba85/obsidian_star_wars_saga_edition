*This homebrew Heroic Class is based on the Heroic Class of Tech Specialist in the RCR version of the Star Wars RPG from Wizards of the Coast. This Heroic Class was created by darth_borehd and was posted on the D20 Forums before the forums were shut down. The name was changed to avoid confusion with the [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) of the same name, the [Tech Specialist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_Specialist).*
### Class Summary
While some beings are skilled when it comes to computers, only Technicians can truly master technology. Whether the techie works with the law, against the law, or around the law, they can usually find employment with anyone. Their abilities are especially prized on metropolis worlds where computers and [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids) run everything, but they also get by on Rim worlds.

#### **Examples of Technicians in Star Wars**
Bao Dur, BB-8, Filli, Ghent, Jan Ors, Kiph, R2-D2.
