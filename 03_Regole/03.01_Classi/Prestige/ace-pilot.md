*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

The Ace Pilot is to [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) combat what the [Elite Trooper](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Trooper) is to personal weapons combat. Her arms and armor are the weapons and shields of a sleek starship roaring through space, or an airspeeder shrieking through the atmosphere. A veteran of countless engagements, the Ace Pilot has proven her skill again and again by virtue of facing the enemy and surviving- and making sure the enemy did not. She has several kills to her credit, and her combat maneuvers are occasionally studied and discussed in training academies for their ingenuity and effectiveness.

For her part, the Ace Pilot only feels truly alive in the cockpit, where she can pit herself against her peers in a life-and-death contest to see who is the better pilot. For some Ace Pilots, the contest is enough, and they don't care whether they win or simply get away with their lives. For others, the important thing is the kill. The adrenaline surge they feel when finishing off an enemy brings them back again and again. The best Ace Pilots learn to stop enemies without destroying them, but those Ace Pilots are rare, and their exploits are legendary.

Ace Pilots define themselves by the [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) they fly. Some are starfighter aces, while others fly space transporters. Ace Pilots can also be found at the controls of a podracer, [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) air taxi, or even a large assault [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) such as an [AT-AT](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/AT-AT).

Any condition that makes you lose your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.
