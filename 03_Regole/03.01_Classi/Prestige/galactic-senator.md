*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

The Senator is the symbol of democracy that the Republic and New Republic stands for. Each Galactic Senator represents their world or a number of worlds to help gain their best interests in galactic politics. From the early days of the Republic over 25,000 years ago to [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), the Galactic Senator has bargained, lied, threatened or negotiated policy to perpetuate the Republic.

Senators come from all walks of life. Depending on the worlds they represent, senators may be [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), or even former [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/jedi.md|Jedi]]. Whatever their origin, they all have one thing in common: they have the ability to negotiate. Some learn their skills as a natural talent. Some are rigorously trained. The result is roughly the same- Galactic Senators use their voice and their personalities, much like soldiers use weapons or Jedi use lightsabers.

The fate of the galaxy may rest on the word of one senator. Galactic Representatives may also be represented here with the Galactic Senator Prestige Class.
