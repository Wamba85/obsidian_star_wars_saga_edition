The term Gray Jedi had two meanings. First, it was used by Jedi and Sith to describe Force users who walked the line between the light and dark sides of the [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) without surrendering to the dark side, and second, it described Jedi who distanced themselves from the Jedi High Council and operated outside the structures of the [Jedi Code](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Code). The term also sometimes referred to unorthodox or dissident Jedi who did not meet the strictest requirements of being a Jedi. For example, some members of the Jedi Order the Jedi thought of Qui-Gon Jinn as a Gray Jedi for his disagreements with the High Council.

Gray Jedi called on the dark side of the [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), but were not corrupted by it and did not embrace it entirely. In fact, some Gray Jedi opposed those who embraced the dark side; Bindo fought against the Sith Empire during the Great Sith War and again during the Jedi Civil War. While Gray Jedi displayed a lack of adherence to the light side of the Force, they were free of dark-side corruption; beings who were corrupted by the dark side were not considered Gray Jediâ€”nor were Jedi who fell to the dark side and were later redeemed. Still, some Jedi thought that Gray Jedi carried the dark side's influence within them, even if the Gray Jedi did not always realize it.  For this trait and usage of the Force, the Gray Jedi walked a tight path in danger of succumbing to the dark side in moments of weakness.

#### **Examples of Gray Jedi in Star Wars**

The number of times this can be achieved per day is equal to half your Class level rounded down.
