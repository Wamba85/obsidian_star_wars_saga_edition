Where there is law, there are those who would break it, circumvent it, and fly in its face. Outlaws are rogue individuals who rightly or wrongly have crossed the line and now pay the price for their indiscretion. Naturally, Outlaws cover a lot of territory, from freedom fighters waging a private war against tyranny to bloodthirsty cutthroats and murderers wanted in twelve systems.

Outlaws can include a whole host of characters, but the most notorious Outlaws are those who make being outside the law their primary profession. Their exploits are the stuff of legend, bucking authority and causing so much trouble that arrest warrants have been issued.

Outlaws sometimes earn respect from common citizens of the galaxy. Regardless of the crimes they commit to earn their outlaw status, their ability to evade capture resonates with those who have suffered from oppression. In some systems, Outlaws can even get supplies, shelter, and support from common folk, and if they help these people, they might be seen as true heroes.

#### **Hit Points**
At each level, Outlaws gain 1d8 Hit Points + their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
#### **Force Points**
Outlaws gain a number of [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) equal to 6 + one-half their Character Level, rounded down, each time they gain a new level in this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).
#### **Defense Bonuses**
At 1st level, Outlaws gain a +2 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), and a +4 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense).
#### **Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), an Outlaw gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). An Outlaw may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [Talent Trees (Outlaw)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees_(Outlaw)) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). No [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.

#### **Fugitive**
Outlaws must stay one step ahead of the authorities and bounty hunters or risk capture and death. An Outlaw's experiences have taught them to be fast on their feet. Once per encounter, starting at 2nd level, an Outlaw can move 1 additional square whenever they use the [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) Action.

Thus, if an Outlaw has a base speed of 6, they can [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) up to 4 squares (3 for half speed, +1 for this ability). This bonus increases by 1 at every even level thereafter (+2 squares at 4th, +3 at 6th, +4 at 8th, and +5 at 10th).
