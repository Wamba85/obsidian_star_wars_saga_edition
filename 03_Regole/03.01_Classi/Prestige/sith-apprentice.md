The Sith Apprentice combines combat mastery with the power of [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side), to create a living embodiment of rage and savagery. Physical conditioning and punishing discipline make the Sith Apprentice into a formidable opponent, and facility with the powers of [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) add a wicked barb to an otherwise deadly weapon. The Sith Apprentice is dedicated to the conquest and subjugation of any obstacle to [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith). Throughout history, a single Sith Apprentice has usually been more than a match for most Jedi. When Sith Apprentices gathered in numbers, as they did four thousand years before the days of Darth Maul and Darth Tyranus, the galaxy trembled.

But those times are gone, and the few Sith Apprentices to appear since the rule of Darth Bane have worked in secrecy to preserve [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith), and prepare for their ultimate conquest of the galaxy. In the thousand years since Bane established the rule of "One Master and One Apprentice," foot soldiers, outlaws, warlords, mercenaries, pirates, fighter pilots, survivalists, duelists, and even the occasional [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/Prestige/jedi-knight.md|Jedi Knight]] have turned to [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) and embraced the way of [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith), becoming mighty warriors, dying brutal deaths, or both. The way of the Sith Apprentice is a constant, unforgiving test of will and ability, honing each into a blade fearsome enough to cut through the heart of the hated Jedi Order. Every Sith Apprentice dreams of being the one who will destroy this ancient foe of [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith).

The training of a Sith Apprentice is always one of deprivation and hardship. Mercy and forbearance create a weak weapon, and such a weapon is useless. The Sith Apprentice is subjugated to endless conditioning and drilling. Displays of fear or uncertainty are rewarded with painful and educational punishment. Displays of strength and ruthlessness are rewarded with another day's survival. The Sith Apprentice learns to live for the precious few words of encouragement their Master gives, and the dream that they will one day stand atop a pile of slain Jedi. For the Sith Apprentice, furious battle is it's own reward.
