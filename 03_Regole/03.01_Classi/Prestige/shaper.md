Among the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]], Shapers are the engineers of [Biotechnology](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Biotechnology). Their skills afford them special distinction and allow them to command great respect in [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] society. Nearly everything used by [The Yuuzhan Vong Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Yuuzhan_Vong_Empire), from their world-affecting terraformers to simple garments, are manufactured by Shapers.

Shapers once adhered to strict protocols that acted as blueprints for their creations. Violation of Shaper protocols could result in harsh punishments and accusations of heresy, but during [The Legacy Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legacy_Era) these repercussions are generally ignored by [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] who are far removed from their people. This allows some Shapers to use their biotechnical expertise on non-[[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]]- a practice that is unpredictable and oftentimes abominable.

#### **Hit Points**
At each level, Shapers gain 1d8 Hit Points + their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
#### **Force Points**
Shapers, like all [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]], never gain [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points).
#### **Defense Bonuses**
At 1st level, Shapers gain a +4 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), and a +2 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense).
#### **Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), a Shaper gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). A Shaper may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [Talent Trees (Shaper)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees_(Shaper)) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). No [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.

#### **Shaper Lore**
A Shaper is skilled at building, modifying, and repairing [Biotechnology](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Biotechnology). Because of this intimate familiarity, a Shaper gains a bonus equal to one-half their Class Level (rounded down) on all [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)) and [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) checks made with regards to [Biotech](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Biotech), regardless of size or complexity.

#### **Shaper Hand**
At 6th level, a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] Shaper is expected to replace at least one of their hands with what is known as a Shaper Hand. A Shaper Hand is a bioengineered appendage equipped with a number of tools that assist in tasks specific to Shaping. A Shaper who declines to attach a Shaper Hand when permitted to do so is often viewed with suspicion by other [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]].

A Shaper Hand replaces the need for a [Biotech Tool Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Biotech_Tool_Kit).
