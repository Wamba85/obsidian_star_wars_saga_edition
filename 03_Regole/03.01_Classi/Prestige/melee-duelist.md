Throughout the history of the galaxy, dueling has seen many degrees of acceptability, militarily, legally, and socially. Some cultures or subcultures regard dueling as an honorable and civilized method of settling disputes, but others see dueling as barbaric. During [The Old Republic Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era), melee combat has resurged, forcing many to study dueling as a means to survive on the battlefield. In addition, dueling is still regarded as a sport on many planets. In fact, dueling is allowed on more civilized worlds than gladiatorial combat, given the higher cultural status dueling enjoys.

The Melee Duelist specializes in fighting a single opponent. The Melee Duelist selects a primary weapon of choice, studying and practicing maneuvers, feints, and tricks to perfection. Competitive duelists train with several types of weapons because they may not know ahead of time which types of weapons will be used in a duel. Battlefield duelists expand their abilities to take on small groups, because they cannot depend on the luxury of fighting a single opponent in the middle of a skirmish. Jedi can also become Melee Duelists to improve their [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) combat, and expand their knowledge beyond the standard Jedi [[03_Regole/03.04_Talenti/lightsaber-forms-talent-tree.md|Lightsaber Forms]]. Sith of all ranks and types can specialize in Melee Duelist, as many of them do not have direct access to learning [[03_Regole/03.04_Talenti/lightsaber-forms-talent-tree.md|Lightsaber Forms]].
