Most warriors become proficient with a variety of weapons, but Martial Arts Masters strive to master various styles of hand-to-hand combat, shunning blasters and turning their bodies into powerful weapons. Although other combatants are satisfied with learning the basics of unarmed combat, Martial Arts Masters learn the techniques and philosophies of many different styles of martial arts, incorporating different elements and techniques into unique personal styles. They are among the most self-sufficient and the most dangerous fighters in the galaxy.

Martial Arts Masters focus on perfecting their art, but many different paths lead to that goal. Some Martial Arts Masters withdraw from the galaxy, honing their skills in small, isolated enclaves. Others use their prowess in the defense of the helpless and innocent in a manner befitting a Jedi Knight. Some make their lethal skills available to the highest bidder, and still others hold positions of influence with criminal cartels, using their deadly fighting abilities to ruthlessly maintain their rank.
