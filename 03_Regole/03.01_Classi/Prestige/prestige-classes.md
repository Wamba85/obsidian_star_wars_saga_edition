  All Prestige Classes have certain requirements that a character must fulfill prior to taking the first level in that class. Among the most common requirements are a minimum Character Level, a minimum [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus), being Trained in certain [skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/skills), or having certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats).
  
  These requirements make it easier for certain types of characters to become members of a given Prestige Class. For example, a [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/scout.md|Scout]] could potentially take their first level of [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/Prestige/bounty-hunter.md|Bounty Hunter]] as an 8th-level character.

Prestige Classes offer abilities and powers otherwise inaccessible to heroes and GM characters, focusing them in specific directions. A character with a Prestige Class is generally more specialized, yet perhaps slightly more powerful, than a character without one.

A character can't begin as a member of a Prestige Class. Abilities granted by Prestige Classes are acquired only by meeting the requirements specific to each example, which almost always demand- in effect- that a character be a least mid-level. Additionally, there may be non-rules-related requirements that must be met in-game, such as group membership fees, special training exercises, or quests.

Prestige Classes are purely optional, and always under the purview of the Gamemaster. Even though a few examples can be found below, they are idiosyncratic to each campaign, and thus many Gamemasters may choose to not allow them or only use them for GM characters.

### Requirements
All Prestige Classes have certain requirements that a character must fulfill prior to taking the first level in that class. Among the most common requirements are a minimum Character Level, a minimum [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus), being Trained in certain [skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/skills), or having certain [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats).

These requirements make it easier for certain types of characters to become members of a given Prestige Class. For example, a [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/scout.md|Scout]] could potentially take their first level of [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/Prestige/bounty-hunter.md|Bounty Hunter]] as an 8th-level character.
## Prestige Classes
The following table summarizes the Prestige Classes described in the *Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*. Some Prestige Classes (such as [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/Prestige/crime-lord.md|Crime Lord]], [Sith Apprentice](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Apprentice), and [Sith Lord](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord)) are more appropriate for GM characters, and the Gamemaster may declare these classes off-limits for heroes.

For this reason, a player should consult with their Gamemaster before angling her character toward a particular Prestige Class.
