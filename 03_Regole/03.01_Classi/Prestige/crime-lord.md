*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Few societies manage to eradicate crime altogether. In the underworld, someone always rises to the top, either through vision, organization, or sheer intimidation. The life of a Crime Lord isn't for the timid. After conquering an unseen empire, the Crime Lord wages a daily struggle not only to stay on top, but also to stay alive.

Of course, not every Crime Lord is bent on corrupting society and making a profit. Some use their criminal connections to wage lucrative guerrilla wars against tyrants and despots. Indeed, some of the lesser-known heroes of the Rebellion began as smugglers or pirates, and eventually rose through the ranks of their organization to provide a more noble direction for their groups' activities. Although some did so to remove an obstacle to making more money, others recognized that ridding the galaxy of the Empire's evil was a more important long-term goal.

Problematically, Crime Lords are notoriously bad at cooperating with one another. The head of any given criminal empire has as much to fear from a gang war as they do from internal dissent and ambitious underlings. Even those with altruistic intentions sometimes learn the hard way that their troops are more interested in gaining power and wealth than saving the galaxy from greater evils.
