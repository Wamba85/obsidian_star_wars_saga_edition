*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

Found in seedy spaceports throughout the galaxy, Charlatans are swindlers and con artists, thieves of the highest order. They specialize in double-cross, using graft, deception, and misdirection to part their victims from their hard-earned credits. Charlatans have the dangerous ability to convince others that handing over their credits is a good idea, even when every instinct screams that they should not.

Of all the rogues one is likely to meet, the Charlatan is the most innocuous. A Charlatan never holds a person at blaster-point, demanding their victims empty out their pockets. A Charlatan that fails to dupe a victim simply moves on to find easier prey. In fact, in some corners of the galaxy, Charlatans are regarded as heroic, especially those who rip off folks who are just as corrupt as they are.

Individuals become Charlatans not out of greed or want, but because their talents are well suited for espionage. Spies, infiltrators, and other intelligence agents can also double as Charlatans to mask their true intentions while trying to learn information, acquire a precious object, or sabotage an enemy.

#### **Hit Points**
At each level, Charlatans gain 1d8 Hit Points + their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
#### **Force Points**
Charlatans gain a number of [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) equal to 6 + one-half their Character Level, rounded down, each time they gain a new level in this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).
#### **Defense Bonuses**
At 1st level, Charlatans gain a +4 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), and a +2 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense).
#### **Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), a Charlatan gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). A Charlatan may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [Talent Trees (Charlatan)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees_(Charlatan)) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). No [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.
#### **Score**
When a Charlatan takes the time to observe a potential victim, they gain useful clues and insights about his or her desires and motives. If a Charlatan spends a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) watching a single target, until the end of the encounter that Charlatan can reroll all [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) checks made against that target, keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Swindle**
A Charlatan can take advantage of potential scores, using the information they learned to dupe them into believing that the Charlatan is on the up-and-up. A Charlatan can substitute [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) checks for [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks made to [Pick Pocket](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pick_Pocket). A successful check does not mean that the Charlatan picks the target's pockets, but rather that they have convinced the target to give them the desired object of the target's own free will. Generally, a target realizes what they have done at the end of the encounter.

At 6th level, a Charlatan gains a +1 bonus to these checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 8th level, and +5 at 10th level.
