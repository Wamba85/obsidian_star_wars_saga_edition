Jedi Masters represent the pinnacle of the Jedi order. They are Jedi who are both strong enough in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), and patient enough in life to pass on their skills by teaching a new generation of Jedi. The journey from Padawan Learner to Jedi Master usually takes decades, and many who start upon the path never reach its final destination.

Becoming a Jedi Master requires patience, inner strength, wisdom, and a deep connection to, and understanding of, [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Further, a [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/Prestige/jedi-knight.md|Jedi Knight]] usually doesn't become a Jedi Master until they train a student to completion. Jedi are allowed only one Padawan at a time, and the training of a single Padawan can take years.

The most respected Jedi Masters are invited by their peers (And, in some cases, their former Masters) to join them on the Jedi Council. Those who join the Council use their wisdom and influence to instruct others in the ways of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), and preserve peace in the galaxy. The Jedi Council is also tasked with identifying Force-sensitive children across the galaxy, and offering them instructions in the Jedi [Force Tradition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Tradition). These lessons are fairly rudimentary- usually intended to teach a student "The Basics" until he or she is old enough to receive formal training as a Padawan.

During the Rise of the Empire era, the Jedi Council would confer the title of Jedi Master upon those deemed qualified to teach others in the ways of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). During the Rebellion era and the New Jedi Order era, Jedi require no such approval; however, they must adhere to the tenets of the [Jedi Code](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Code) to become Jedi Masters.

#### **Hit Points**
At each level, Jedi Masters gain 1d10 hit points + their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
#### **Force Points**
Jedi Masters gain a number of [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) equal to 7 + one-half their Character Level, rounded down, each time they gain a new level in this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class) (Due to their strong connection to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), Jedi Masters gain more [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) than most other [Prestige Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Classes)).
#### **Defense Bonuses**
At 1st level, Jedi Masters gain a +3 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), and [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense).
#### **Fearless**
Jedi Masters are immune to Fear effects.
#### **Serenity**
The Jedi Master may enter a brief meditative state as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). The Jedi Master may remain in this trance as long as they wish, and they are still aware of their surroundings; however, the Jedi Master is otherwise [Helpless](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Helpless) and cannot perform any other [Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Actions). Upon emerging from the trance (as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action)), the Jedi Master's first attack roll or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill check made in the following round is considered to be a [Natural 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Natural_20).
#### **Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), a Jedi Master gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). A Jedi Master may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [Talent Trees (Jedi Master)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees_(Jedi_Master)) or [Force Talent Trees](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Talent_Trees) (including [Force Tradition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Tradition) Talent Trees) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). No [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.

#### **Force Secrets**
You have glimpsed an eternal truth through your contemplation of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). At 2nd level, and every level thereafter, the Jedi Master gains one [Force Secret](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Secret) that, once selected, cannot be changed.
