*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Among the Jedi, those of the order who have proven capable, wise, self-sufficient, and stable are given the rank of Knight. A Jedi apprentice must learn to use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) without instability or strain, build their own [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers), and show an understanding of the [Jedi Code](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Code) (though such understanding may shift from era to era, as the nature of the Jedi differs somewhat in each era). During most eras, a Jedi must pass a series of tests before becoming a Jedi Knight, which may be as simple as fulfilling a single important mission assigned by a [Jedi Master](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Master), or as complex as a series of trials to test the Jedi's mettle, ethics, and dedication. In a few of chaos and uncertainty, Jedi apprentices are forced by circumstance to push themselves past the normal boundaries of their training and become Knights in function, if not in name, with no formal testing. In these rare cases, the ruling Jedi generally acknowledge the Jedi's status as a Knight as soon as circumstances allow.

Jedi Knights are trusted to teach apprentices, carry out missions with little aid or support, and use their best judgment when handling the unexpected. A Jedi Knight is expected to deal with any problem in a manner that reflects well on the Jedi as a whole, and carry out the Jedi goals of defending justice and maintaining peace. Jedi are the guardians of the galaxy, and the Jedi Knight is a skilled individual expected to uphold that trust.
