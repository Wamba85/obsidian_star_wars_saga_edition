*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

The galaxy is a dangerous place. Vicious creatures, massive battles, barroom brawls, lethal environments, and other kinds of threats imperil people everywhere. Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel provide vital care to the critically injured, but are less available to those operating in the field. The Medic fills this void, providing on-the-spot advanced medical treatment and support.

Medics are highly trained healers, able to function in the worst of conditions and circumstances. They possess great knowledge of the healing arts and sciences. They know quick and effective treatment methods and use them to perform near-miracles to save injured and dying creatures.

Medics live to heal others. The most altruistic among them heal any and all within their abilities. Disillusioned or vengeful Medics might choose to heal only their allies and companions. Many Medics serve as starship medical officers, battlefield surgeons, or corporate medical personnel, or in portable medical facilities. A medic on the shadier side of society might operate a back-alley clinic, serve a criminal organization, or work as the personal physician of a crime lord.
