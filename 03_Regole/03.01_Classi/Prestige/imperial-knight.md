[The Imperial Knights](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Imperial_Knights) are [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/jedi.md|Jedi]] who dedicate themselves to the preservation of [The Fel Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fel_Empire) and the defense of Emperor Roan Fel- not unlike the Royal Guard that once protected Emperor Palpatine, though their training in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) distinguishes them from that organization. Despite opinions to the contrary, Imperial Knights are every bit as capable in the use of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) as their [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/jedi.md|Jedi]] counterparts, though their training has considerably more martial focus. During the height of the Sith-Imperial War, [The Imperial Knights](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Imperial_Knights) were forbidden from participating in the fighting. Instead, they served as the Emperor's personal guard.

At any given time, there are as few as a dozen Imperial Knights or as many as three score. Casualties within the Order have been high since Darth Krayt declared himself Emperor. The remaining Imperial Knights continue to serve Roan Fel closely, with many fighting an insurgent war against [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith) and their Imperial forces.

Recruitment within [The Imperial Knights](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Imperial_Knights) is limited to individuals who demonstrate both [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) potential and loyalty to Roan Fel. Like [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi), Imperial Knights are permitted to take on apprentices, but only one at a time and only once they have mastered their own skills to a sufficient degree. Apprenticeships are personally approved by the Emperor, as are promotions within the structure of the Order. Only the highest ranking Imperial Knight is designated as a "Master," subject to Roan Fel's approval.

Imperial Knights reject the use of [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), yet true [[03_Regole/03.01_Classi/jedi.md|Jedi]] still feel that [The Imperial Knights](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Imperial_Knights) lack a balanced approach to their use of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Controlling fear and managing one's emotions in the face of adversity is paramount to the ideology of [The Imperial Knights](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Imperial_Knights), as is loyalty to their Emperor. They are warriors first and foremost, not negotiators, and they make no excuses for this fact.
