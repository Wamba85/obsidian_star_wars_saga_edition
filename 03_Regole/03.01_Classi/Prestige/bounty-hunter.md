*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

The Bounty Hunter capitalizes on the vendettas of others, tracking down fugitives for their enemies, their masters, or simply for justice. The best Bounty Hunters are the ones who can stay emotionally detached from either their employers or their quarry- although Bounty Hunters who hate their prey often make more spectacular kills.

Not all Bounty Hunters kill. Some employers reserve that pleasure for themselves, or plan to give the quarry a more or less fair trial. Some Bounty Hunters have reservations about taking lives unnecessarily. Regardless of their methods, a Bounty Hunter still has to produce the quarry in order to receive payment. Overkill is generally not a good idea.

At one time, organized Bounty Hunter guilds appropriated contracts and policed their membership. They dwindled in both power and organization during the rise of Emperor Palpatine.

Whether working alone or in groups, Bounty Hunters revel in the thrill of the hunt. Given the nature of their work, it goes without saying that few Bounty Hunters die of boredom.

By observing your opponent in combat, you know how to defeat them more easily.

The effects last until the end of the encounter. You cannot use this ability until after your opponent has acted during the combat.
