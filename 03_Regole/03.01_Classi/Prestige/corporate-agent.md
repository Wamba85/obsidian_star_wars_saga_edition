Intersteller corporations hold a large amount of power in all eras of play. In some regions, the corporations control enough systems to operate as the de facto government. However, most are spread across countless worlds throughout the galaxy. Their presence varies, ranging from near dominance of a local market, to only having a single office, store, or facility. Major corporations have agents of their own, looking after company interests. These agents might specialize in security, fraud, exploration, administration, or many other aspects of management and production. They operate in the open or covertly, normally restricting their activities to keeping an eye on their own company, but corporations can use agents for corporate espionage, or even sabotaging competitors.

Corporate Agents might wield as much or more power than government agents. Some agents find the company is their life. Indeed, with each promotion, they might find that the company demands more and more of their time in exchange for increased status, power, and pay.
