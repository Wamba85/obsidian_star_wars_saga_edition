Survival should not be taken for granted in the war-torn galaxy, particularly on the fringes of civilization where resources can be scarce. One of the most important skills for fending off death is the ability to think quickly when the need arises. Improvisers can quickly grasp the needs of a situation, analyze what tools are at hand, remember relevant information, and combine all these factors into a hasty (though not necessarily elegant) solution. Although Improvisors specialize in mechanical marvels, they also have a moderate aptitude in almost any skill or area of knowledge.

#### **Prerequisites**
To qualify to become an Improviser, a character must fulfill the following criteria:
- **Minimum Level: **7th
- **[Trained Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skills): **[Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics), [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer)
- **[Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats):** [Skill Focus (Mechanics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Mechanics))

| 9th | <nowiki>+6</nowiki> | Talent]] |
| 10th | <nowiki>+7</nowiki> | Contraband (10,000 credits) |

#### **Hit Points**
At each level, Improvisers gain 1d8 Hit Points + their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.

#### **Force Points**
Improvisers gain a number of [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) equal to 6 + one-half their Character Level, rounded down, each time they gain a new level in this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).

#### **Defense Bonuses**
At 1st level, Improvisers gain a +2 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), and a +4 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).

#### **Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), an Improviser gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). An Improviser may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [[03_Regole/03.04_Talenti/talent-trees-improviser.md|Talent Trees (Improviser)]] they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). No [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.

#### **No Tools Required**
The Improviser can use parts of machines and electronics as tools, eliminating the need for a [Security Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Security_Kit) or a [Tool Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tool_Kit) when attempting [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) or [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) checks that would normally require such a tool. The Improviser is always considered to be using a [Tool Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tool_Kit) or [Security Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Security_Kit), even when he or she does not have one.

#### **Contraband**
At 2nd level, an Improviser gains access to illegal goods through their underworld connections. An Improviser can obtain any combination of items that have an availability of [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare) or [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal), up to a total value of 2,000 credits x one-half their Class Level (rounded down). The Improviser does not need to pay [Black Market](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Market) multipliers on these goods, only their base value. Obtaining any combination of these goods requires one hour of work in a civilized or semi-civilized area.

The Improviser can select those goods immediately, or over the course of their level. However, if the Improviser levels up without having reached their Contraband limit, any additional credits' worth of goods are lost, and the Improviser's budget for obtaining [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare) and [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal) items resets with the new level.
