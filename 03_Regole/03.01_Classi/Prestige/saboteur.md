Saboteurs aim to disrupt or destroy the physical mechanisms of their enemies, usually covertly and often from within. They might use improvised tools or create specialized devices to carry out certain tasks. They rely on stealth and secrecy to carry out their missions. A Saboteur might work alone in a single installation, or as a part of a small group for complex or widespread attacks. Saboteur missions employ explosives, computer slicing, [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) reprogramming, and social engineering to achieve their goals.

The best Saboteurs focus their attacks and methods for maximum disruption and damage to the systems, objects, or [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) they want to affect. Collateral damage is typically unwanted and counterproductive to their cause, especially to sensitive or nonmilitary targets. Many targets are disabled rather than destroyed, but the results can still be very effective and demoralizing to an enemy. Many Saboteurs must make the most out of limited supplies, which often forces them to make precise attacks to avoid wasting resources.

During the Dark Times, Saboteurs are among the most radical and prolific of the anti-Imperial factions. They might appear at any installation, though high security measures make their attacks less likely. Skilled Saboteurs are difficult for Imperials to defend against, and therefore they are ruthlessly pursued by all Imperial organizations, especially the [Imperial Security Bureau](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Security_Bureau).

#### **Force Points**
Saboteurs gain a number of [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) equal to 6 + one-half their Character Level, rounded down, every time they gain a new level in this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).

At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), a Saboteur gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). A Saboteur may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [Talent Trees (Saboteur)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees_(Saboteur)) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent).

#### **Unexpected Results**
Saboteurs occasionally see the results of their work, even at the most at unexpected moments.

#### **Destructive**
Starting at 2nd level, a Saboteur always deals double damage to unattended objects and [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles).

#### **Quick Sabotage**
Saboteurs know how to disable [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) quickly and efficiently. Saboteurs can attempt a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to disable a device by using improvised tools if no [Security Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Security_Kit) is available. At 4th level, a Saboteur can attempt to disable Simple Devices as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). At 6th level, a Saboteur can attempt to disable Tricky Devices as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). At 8th level, a Saboteur can attempt to disable Complex Devices using two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions).

#### **Master Saboteur**
When a Saboteur reaches 10th level, they excel at inhibiting and destroying enemy [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment). 10th level Saboteurs can reroll any [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to disable a device or [Handle Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Handle_Explosives), keeping the better of the two results.
