*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Since the first primitive [Slugthrower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Slugthrower) was developed thousands of years ago, there have been soldiers of fortune focused on [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) fighting. The tradition grew with the technology, creating a special breed of blaster-wielding freelancers who shoot first, and ask questions later. Often wandering guns-for-hire, bodyguards in fringe areas, professional duelists, or even assassins, these fighters know about pistols of all descriptions.

They can draw faster, shoot faster, and aim more accurately with their weapons of choice than any other category of warrior. Some use their prowess to defend the weak and battle injustice, while others use their skill to gain fast and easy credits. Regardless of motivation, Gunslingers seek to use their focused combat techniques to gain greater fame, and wield that fame as a weapon against less well-known foes.
