The Force Adept is strong in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), but follows a different path than that of the Jedi. To the Force Adept, [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) and the aid it provides are more mysterious, and more supernatural. A Force Adept comes from a different [Force Tradition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Tradition), with different beliefs and codes of conduct than those of the Jedi. There are precious few Force Adepts in the galaxy, and even fewer become adventurers. Some call [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) by it's familiar name, while others refer to it by some other term entirely.

Some Force Adepts become adventurers as part of a quest to learn more about [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) (or whatever they choose to call it). Others do so out of necessity. They are forced from their world, hunted by unscrupulous agents, or are interested in what the galaxy has to offer them. Force Adepts might be called wizards, shamans, witches, or prophets, depending on where they come from, and what [Force Tradition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Tradition) they follow. Most Force Adepts follow the [Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Side) (or at least a variation of it), but some fully embrace the [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side) and use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) for evil or selfish intent.

Force Adepts usually hail from primitive cultures that revere or fear them for their Force powers. Some strive to keep their powers secret, both because they do not fully understand them, and because they are afraid of how others might treat them.
