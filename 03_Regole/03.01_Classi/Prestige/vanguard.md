Fighting an effective war and taking out the enemy is necessary if your army is to live to fight another day. But you must find the enemy first, and those sensor results can be a little deceptive at times. Send out the Vanguard to track them down.

Vanguards, simply put, are advance scouts who specialize in locating the enemy and relaying its position to their allies. With the stealth and sharp senses required to achieve their goals, they specialize in locating and observing the enemy's movements, all the while obscuring their presence from them. If the situation arises, they might try to take a few of the enemy down before retreating back to friendly territory, but their primary purpose is to serve as their group's eyes and ears.

Vanguards are typically attached to military units near the front lines. They operate best in small groups as individuals. In either case, Vanguards excel at sneaking close to hostile forces, stealing away with the knowledge of their location, and watching them fall to the might of their allies.
