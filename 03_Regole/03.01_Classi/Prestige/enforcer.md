*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

The vital task of law enforcement takes many forms throughout the galaxy. Backwater constables, [The Sector Rangers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sector_Rangers), corporate security forces, city police, and some types of Imperial agents are a few of the typical examples. The rise of the Empire and its ever-growing governmental intrusiveness brings about a great increase in Enforces of all types.

Enforcers are elite law enforcement officers and agents. In respectable organizations, they are the most skilled investigators, the best patrol officers, and often leaders within their departments. In corrupt organizations, they might use special connections to gain their position, but they still have a degree of ability, if not integrity. Both honest and corrupt Enforcers can be found at any level and any organization.

Honest Enforcers are dedicated and driven to keep the peace and capture the bad guys. They often aspire to high levels of morality, fairness, and justice. Just because they're honest doesn't mean they don't support the Empire. They might be dedicated to the Empire's ideals, yet unaware or disbelieving of its worst offenses.

Corrupt Enforcers are self-serving. They use their position to gain personal fortune or power, operating individually or in concert with others in their organization. They might not possess the appropriate attitude for the job, but they have at least enough skill to hang on to it.

An Enforcer's duties and abilities vary by assignment. Urban patrols pursue suspects through congested cityscapes. [The Sector Rangers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sector_Rangers) use a broad set of ability to track down criminals throughout their own sector of space. Imperial Security Bureau and COMPNOR agents rely on political power and fear as much as natural investigative talents and training to hunt down rebels and other opponents of the New Order.

In a campaign set in [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times), Enforcer character might find their loyalty to their positions as upholders of the law conflicting with the new political reality of the New Order. How these Enforcers balance this pressure should be integral to character development and have some influence on the direction of the campaign.

#### **Force Points**
Enforcers gain a number of [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) equal to 6 + one-half their Character Level, rounded down, every time they gain a new level in this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).

#### **Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), an Enforcer gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). An Enforcer may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [Talent Trees (Enforcer)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees_(Enforcer)) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent).

#### **Resources**
An Enforcer has access to additional Resources provided by their department or organization.

The [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) appears in a civilized, accessible location of the Enforcer's choice.

An Enforcer may choose not to receive any Resources when they gain a level, instead adding the value of any Equipment they would normally gain to the Resources they gain at their next level.

#### **Targeted Suspect**
The time an Enforcer spends investigating a suspect results in benefits when dealing with the individual during an encounter. If an Enforcer spends a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) observing an opponent in combat, they gain a bonus on attack rolls and [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception), [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception), and [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks equal to one-half the Enforcer's Class Level (rounded down). The benefits last for the remainder of the encounter. An Enforcer cannot use this ability until after their target has acted during combat.
