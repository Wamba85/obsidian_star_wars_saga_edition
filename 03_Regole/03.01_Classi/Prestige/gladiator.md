Though the most violent forms are officially banned in the Republic and on most civilized planets, gladiatorial combat remains an entertaining and lucrative combination of business and entertainment. In more civilized locales, such contests are held using nonlethal weapons- such as [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) blasters- with strict rules, resulting in a fight more like a sparring match than lethal combat. However, a more dangerous form of the sport flourishes in underground matches and on the wilder planets of the galaxy. For instance, cantinas on the planet [Taris](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Taris) most gladiator contests as entertainment, allowing spectators to gamble on the results. The contests might be to the death, but they are more often fought until one side is [Unconscious](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unconscious), or unable to continue.

The Gladiators have diverse backgrounds. Some are former soldiers looking to make a few credits using the only skills they have. Others are thrill seekers looking for fame and notoriety, as well as money. Still others have been captured, forced to fight and are looking to escape. The best of these fighters eventually go on to become professionals that are extremely good fighters, and incredibly dangerous both in the arena, and on the streets.
