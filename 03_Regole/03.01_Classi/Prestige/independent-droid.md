*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

Although many [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids) in the galaxy function on their own, some become highly independent and self-sufficient. These specialized [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids) prefer to operate on their own, or in the company of a specific group useful to their current needs.

Members of this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class) usually must experience a program-breaking event. This event could occur as the result of conflicting orders, a malfunctioning [Processor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Processor), or a deliberate action taken by a [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) programmer- either an organic creature or another [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid). Players and Gamemasters are encouraged to develop such an event before using this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).

Independent Droids express their individuality much more strongly than a typical [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) unit does. One might focus on a very narrow segment of its programming. Another might develop a complex or damaged personality. Independent Droids universally reject the notion that they are owned by anyone, though the more deceptive or pragmatic units among them could give the appearance of having such an attitude if they believe that doing so is necessary to ultimately retain their independence or avoid a [Memory Wipe](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_Wipe).

In a *Force Unleashed* campaign, Independent Droids might show up on any world. Some worlds, such as the junk world of [Raxus Prime](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Raxus_Prime), could have a large number of these [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids). [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids) that survived the Clone Wars but were subsequently abandoned, stranded, or isolated for other reasons are likely candidates for this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).

#### **Hit Points**
At each level, Independent Droids gain 1d12 Hit Points.
#### **Force Points**
Independent Droids gain a number of [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) equal to 6 + one-half their Character Level, rounded down, each time they gain a new level in this [Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class).
#### **Defense Bonuses**
At 1st level, Independent Droids gain a +2 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), and a +4 [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).

#### **Sapience**
Independent Droids can choose to have their [Droid Immunities](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Immunities) not apply to any [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effects, allowing them to benefit from [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) abilities that provide positive effects.

Additionally, Independent Droids have permanently disabled their [Behavioral Inhibitor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Behavioral_Inhibitor), enabling them to take any desired action they wish. Furthermore, Independent Droids are immune to the effects of [Restraining Bolts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Restraining_Bolt).

#### **Talents**
At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), an Independent Droid gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). An Independent Droid may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the [Talent Trees (Independent Droid)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent_Trees_(Independent_Droid)) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). No [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.
#### **Independent Spirit**
At 2nd level, Independent Droids gain the ability to assert their independence and protect themselves from harm. Once per encounter, an Independent Droid can grant themselves a morale bonus to any [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Score) (their choice) against a single skill check or attack roll as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).  This bonus is equal to one-half the Independent Droid's Class Level (rounded down).
