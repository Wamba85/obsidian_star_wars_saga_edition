*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Scoundrels are rogues- good, bad, and neutral- who either live outside the law or fight against it in order to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region of the galaxy. Most use their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) to accomplish tasks, and many rely on [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) as a fallback when all else fails. The Scoundrel gets by with bravado, cunning, duplicity, and trickery. They live by their wits, lying, cheating, stealing, and even fighting when the need arises.

### Adventurers
Many Scoundrels live a life of adventure for the excitement it provides. Others go adventuring to advance their illicit careers. Some are good-hearted rogues in it for the thrill, or to right a wrong done to them or those they love. Others are despicable knaves who serve only one master- the greed that swells inside them. More often, an adventurous Scoundrel falls somewhere in the middle, changing allegiance and attitudes as the political climate changes, until something larger than himself sets him on a particular course through the galaxy. Adventurous Scoundrels call themselves smugglers, pirates, outlaws, gamblers, slicers, con artists, thieves, rogues, and spies.

### Characteristics
Scoundrels have a knack for getting into and out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous Scoundrels are also (Probably) saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes make them go against their natural inclinations.

### Backgrounds
Scoundrels don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.

#### **Examples of Scoundrels in Star Wars**
