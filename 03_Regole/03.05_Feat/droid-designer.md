prerequisites: "Tech Specialist, Trained in Mechanics"
benefit: "You can design a Droid from scratch. Doing so takes a minimum of 10 days and a DC 25 Mechanics check, adding 1 to the DC and 1 to the time for every additional 10,000 credits of the design's final cost beyond the first 10,000 credits (even a genius Droid Designer can spend months or years perfecting a specialized Droid design). Other characters Trained in the Mechanics skill may use the Aid Another action to assist your Mechanics check; if any assisting character also has the Droid Designer Feat, divide the Droid's cost by the number of characters who have this Feat (including the primary designer) when determining the time required.  Start by selecting a degreeless chassis, which costs 5,000 credits. Then, pick its Droid Degree. The cost is the base price multiplied by 6 - the number of the Droid's Degree. Choose the size; the cost is multiplied again by the Cost Factor of that size. Finally, add whether its 1st level is Nonheroic or Heroic; if the latter, double the cost. Your blank chassis is now ready to receive Droid Systems such as Appendages and Processors, which cost their usual price multiplied by .75. Choose the ability scores of the Droid using a Standard Score Package. The Droid begins at Character Level 1.  You can make custom modifications to Droids. Each of these modifications has a base cost of 500 credits (multiplied by the Cost Factor) and requires a DC 25 Mechanics check. On a failed check, the modification fails; you must spend half again as much time and money to make a second attempt, and you gain a +2 bonus on your Mechanics check for each attempt after the first.  Installation of a custom modification normally takes one day per 5,000 credits of the final cost. The same system can be customized multiple times, but doing so becomes increasingly difficult and expensive. For every previous custom modification on a given system, increase the DC by 5 and the base cost by 10,000 credits. No system can be customized more than three times. Multiple benefits from successive customizations stack. Typical customizations are described below. The Gamemaster may allow other modifications. *Add Upgrade Slot: You add an Upgrade Slot to a Droid as if it were Equipment. Droids all have 0 Upgrade Slots to start with. * Improve Chassis: You add a number of Hit Points to a Droid equal to 1/4 its Strength score (rounded down to the nearest integer, minimum 1). *Improve Locomotion: You can reengineer its locomotion to improve its speed by 1 square. Cannot be added to Immobile Droids. *Improve Shields: The Shield Rating of the shields, if any, is increased by 5. Cannot be added to Droids without a Shield Generator. * Improve Equipment: You grant one tool or weapon integrated into a Droid a +1 Equipment bonus on skill checks, attack rolls, or damage rolls. *Remove Inhibitors: You remove a Droid's inhibition to causing harm. Cannot be added to 4th-Degree Droids. *Improve Ability Score: You increase one Ability Score of the Droid by 1.
