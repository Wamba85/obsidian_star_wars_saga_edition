benefit: "You can install Bio-Implants onto a living being. The surgical procedure takes 1 hour of uninterrupted work, after which you must make a DC 20 Treat Injury check. If the check succeeds, the prosthesis is installed correctly. If the check fails, the prosthesis is not installed properly; however, you can try again after another uninterrupted hour of surgery."
special: "You can install Bio-Implants on yourself, but you take a -5 penalty on the Treat Injury check. If you have the Surgical Expertise Feat, you can install a Bio-Implant in 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Category:Feats Category:Noble Bonus Feats Category:Technician Bonus Feats"
