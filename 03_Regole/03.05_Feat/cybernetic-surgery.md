benefit: "You can install Cybernetic Devices on living beings. The surgical procedure takes 1 hour of uninterrupted work, after which you must make a DC 20 Treat Injury check. If the check succeeds, the Cybernetic Device is installed correctly. If the check fails, the device is not properly installed; however, you can try again after another uninterrupted hour of surgery."
special: "You can install a Cybernetic Prosthesis or Energy-Binding Prosthesis on yourself, but you take a -5 penalty on the Treat Injury skill check (you cannot install a Rhen-Orm Biocomputer or a Subelectronic Converter on yourself). If you have the Surgical Expertise Feat, you can install a Cybernetic Device in 10 minutes instead of 1 hour.
