benefit: "You can make a DC 20 Ride check as a Swift Action to spur your living Mount to move faster than its normal speed. If the check fails, your Mount's Speed does not increase and it moves -1 step on the Condition Track. If the check succeeds, your Mount's Speed increases by 2 squares until the start of your next turn. You cannot Take 10 on this check. Your Mount must succeed on a DC 20 Endurance check prior to each subsequent attempt to use this Feat in the same encounter.  Additionally, once per round, as a Reaction, when you are riding a Mount, you can negate a weapon hit against either you or the Mount by making a successful Ride check. The DC of the Skill Check is equal to the result of the attack roll you want to negate. Category:Feats Category:Noble Bonus Feats Category:Scout Bonus Feats"
