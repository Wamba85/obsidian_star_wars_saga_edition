benefit: "When you successfully make a ranged attack against a single target, you can make a second attack roll against an additional target that is in direct line of sight, and no farther than 6 squares from the original target. If the second attack roll succeeds, make a single damage roll, and divide the damage equally between the two targets. If the second attack roll fails, you deal no damage to either target.
