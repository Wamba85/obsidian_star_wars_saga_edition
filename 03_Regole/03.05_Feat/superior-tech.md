benefit: "Select one of the following: Armor, Weapons, Droids, Vehicles, or Devices. You can install advanced Traits when modifying the selected type of equipment. These Traits replace the Traits granted by the Tech Specialist Feat. You may still use the Tech Specialist options if you so choose.  You must pay one-fifth the cost of the Device, Armor, Weapon, Droid, or vehicle you wish to modify or 2,000 credits, whichever is more, before beginning the modification. This fee replaces the normal cost of modification from the Tech Specialist Feat. Completing the modification requires 1 day per 1,000 credits of the modification's cost. At the end of this time, make a DC 30 Mechanics check; you cannot Take 10 or Take 20 on this check. If the check succeeds, the modification is completed successfully, and the object gains the desired Trait. If the check fails, you lose all credits spent on making the modification, and the object does not gain the desired Trait. However, you can start over from scratch if you wish.  Only characters with the Tech Specialist Feat can assist you, reducing proportionately the time needed to complete the modification. At the end of the modification process, they can make a Mechanics check to aid your check.  The market value of a modified item is equal to the base cost of the item plus double the cost of the modifications made to it (not including credits wasted on failed modification attempts)."
