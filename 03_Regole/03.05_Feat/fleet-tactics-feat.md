prerequisites: "Trained in Knowledge (Tactics)"
benefit: "You add to your Fleet Maneuver Suite a number of Fleet Maneuvers equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (Minimum 1). You can add the same Fleet Maneuver more than once."
special: "You can take this Feat more than once. Each time you take this feat, you add to your Fleet Maneuver Suite a number of new Fleet Maneuvers equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (Minimum 1). If you are the Commander of a Starship, your crew can activate any Fleet Maneuver you know that you order them to use.  GM Note: The special marker here may seem overly powerful, since only one person needs to burn a Feat. However, I found this very useful in enhancing the fun for the players since even those that did not put Feats and Talents into space related things could still be useful in space combat. It also made it worth it for the Captain character to focus so highly.  Despite this, some players did still decide to take the Feat themselves in order to gain more [Gunner] abilities solely for them.
