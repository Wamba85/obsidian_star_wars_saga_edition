prerequisites: "Constitution 13, Shapeshift Species Trait, Trained in Deception"
benefit: "As a Full-Round Action, you can change your mass when you use your Shapeshift Species Trait, increasing or decreasing your size by one step. You can maintain this form for a number of rounds per day equal to your Constitution score.  If you reduce your size to Small, you gain a +1 size bonus to your Reflex Defense and a +5 size bonus on Stealth checks, but your Carrying Capacity is three-quarters of what it was prior to your use of Metamorph.  If you increase your size to Large, you take a -1 penalty to your Reflex Defense and a -5 penalty on Stealth checks. However, your Carrying Capacity doubles, you gain a +5 size bonus to your Damage Threshold, and your Reach increases by 1 square. Category:Feats"
