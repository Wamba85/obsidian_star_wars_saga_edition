benefit: "You gain a single Follower. Choose either the aggressive, defensive, or utility Follower Template for your follower, generating the follower's statistics based on the rules found in the Followers section. This Follower must be of the Assembler Species.  Additionally, every time a Node gains a level, it makes an attack roll (1d20 + the Node's Base Attack Bonus) against your Will Defense. If successful, the Node gains its own autonomy and is no longer bound by the Follower rules. After 24 hours, you may spend a Force Point to regain the benefits of this Feat.
