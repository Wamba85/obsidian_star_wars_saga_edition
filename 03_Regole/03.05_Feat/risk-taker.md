benefit: "You fall only if you fail a Climb check by 10 or more. Additionally, if you make a Jump check and fail to land on a safe or solid surface (such as if you fall into a pit or fail to clear a stream of lava), you can spend a Force Point as a Free Action and add the result of the Force Point roll to your distance jumped. However, you must land in the first available safe square."
