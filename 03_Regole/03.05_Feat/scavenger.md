benefit: "You can spend 1 hour scavenging materials from other Vehicles or objects. When you do so, you make a Perception check to determine the value of the parts scavenged. You produce raw materials equal in value to the result of your Perception check x 30 credits. You must apply these raw materials toward the cost of construction of a single object (see Build Object), and you can scavenge parts for only a single object at any given time. Additionally, you can scavenge raw materials only once for any given object you are attempting to build. Category:Feats Category:Scoundrel Bonus Feats Category:Technician Bonus Feats"
