benefit: "Pick a number of musical instruments (Or voice) equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier. You are considered trained in the use of these instruments. You can spend a Standard Action for ten or more rounds consecutively to play a piece of music by making a DC 15 Persuasion check. You can play a maximum number of consecutive rounds equal to 10 + your Constitution score, after which you must make an Endurance check equal to the number of rounds you have been playing. Failing the check means you must either take two Full-Round Actions as a break, or move -1 step down the Condition Track.  For the duration of your song, all allies within line of sight able to hear gain a +1 morale bonus to Will Defense and Fortitude Defense and may move +1 step on the Condition Track if they were moved down it by a Mind-Affecting effect. Allies may only move +1 step along the Condition Track per song.  Multiple musicians can play together by making Aid Another checks. For every 5 points by which the DC is exceeded, you add +1 to the Will Defense and Fortitude Defense bonuses, to a maximum of the number of members in the band, or 5, whichever is lower. Additionally, Persuasion is always considered a Class Skill for you. Category:Feats Category:Homebrew Content"
