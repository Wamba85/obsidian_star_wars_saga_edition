benefit: "When armed with Syntherope or similar items, you may make ranged Grapple attacks, using the Trip and Pin grapple Feats, if you have them.  This feat also allows you to Grapple, Trip, and Pin entire Squads or Packs as appropriate.  Also, if armed with Syntherope or similar items while engaged in a Grapple, you may make a Grapple attack against your adjacent opponent to bind a specific limb.  Each successful attack binds a limb and provides you with a +2 bonus to further Grapple checks against that opponent until the rope is severed or broken. You may do this a number of times equal to the number of limbs (arms and legs only) the target possesses. Should you bind all of the target’s limbs and then make a Pin attack, the target is considered Pinned for as long as the rope remains unbroken.
