prerequisites: "Biotech Specialist, Intelligence 15, at least 1 level in the Shaper class"
benefit: "You may design and shape new creatures from scratch. Doing so requires a DC 25 Treat Injury check. Other characters with the Biotech Specialist Feat can aid you in making the check with Aid Another.  If you choose to alter a living creature, you can apply any of the traits from the Shaped Beast Template. Each additional Trait after the first increases the DC by 3. Designing a Beast from scratch adds half the Beast's intended Character Level to the DC.  Designing a Living Vehicle from scratch works in much the same way as designing a Starship with the Starship Designer Feat. You take a Stock Ship, build as normal, then apply the Living Vehicle Template. Stock Living Ships have a Constitution score equal to their listed Strength score. The Improve Hull customisation improves the living ship's Constitution score, rather than its Strength score. Category:Feats Category:Homebrew Content Category:Technician Bonus Feats"
