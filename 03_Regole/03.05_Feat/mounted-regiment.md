benefit: "You gain a +3 competence bonus on Ride checks. At the time you make a check, for each ally within 12 squares of you who also has this Feat, the competence bonus increases by +1 (to a maximum of +7).  Additionally, once per round as a Reaction to your Mount being attacked, you can make a Ride check; if the result exceeds the Mount's Reflex Defense, use your check result against the attack instead of using the Mount's Reflex Defense.
