benefit: "When making an Autofire attack with a weapon with which you possess the Weapon Focus feat, you can attack all targets in a 6-Square Cone. The origin square of the cone can be any square in your line of sight and within Point-Blank Range."
special: "This Feat cannot be used with the Autofire Assault feat or the Burst Fire feat. It can be used with the Improved Suppression Fire Talent. ==Homebrew Autofire Sweep Data==  Autofire Sweep data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formally Wikia user Lukewarner).  To prevent this feat from unbalancing a game, have all targets of an attack with the Autofire Sweep feat be treated as though they posses the Evasion Talent.  All targets take half damage from a successful attack, and no damage if the attack misses. If a target of an Autofire Sweep attack already possess the Evasion Talent, then they take no damage regardless of the attack roll. Category:Feats Category:Ranged Feats Category:Soldier Bonus Feats"
