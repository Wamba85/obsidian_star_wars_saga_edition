benefit: "Once per turn, when you miss on an attack roll, you reroll the attack, but you take a -2 penalty to Reflex Defense until the end of your next turn. If your first attack missed because you rolled a Natural 1, you can still use this Feat, but you take a -5 penalty to Reflex Defense instead. You must accept the result of the second roll, even if it's worse than the first. Category:Feats Category:Scoundrel Bonus Feats Category:Technician Bonus Feats"
