*Maelibus Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The Maelibi (often referred to as "Demons") inhabit Iego's core and, for the most part, their existence is known only to the castaways on the planet's surface. Though they are not capable of mind control, those who have seen them still consider them to be even more beautiful than the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/diathim.md|Diathim]]. Maelibi are humanoid giants with bodies of shimmering gold and melodic voices that sing a strange language. Approximately once each year, they select victims from among the castaways and carry them underground for consumption.

Able burrowers, Maelibi use their immense strength, speed, and claws to burrow through the ground rapidly, as well as to create vast tunnel networks. Within these networks, the Maelibi sing hypnotic melodies, their vocal cords producing pitches specifically designed to disrupt brainwaves, confusing in even the strongest sentients; many claim that their lyrical voices were said to be the embodiment of music itself, with none capable of eluding their siren call. When their prey is been drawn in close enough, the Maelibus then explosively burrow out of the ground, and drag their screaming prey beneath the surface, eating them alive.

### Maelibus Characteristics
**Personality:** Maelibi are predators, a fact they take great pride in. A Maelibus will typically stalk a target prior to its death to hone their skills, with little regard for their sentience. While not bloodthirsty, they have no qualms with killing to survive.

**Physical Description:** Maelibi are said to be achingly beautiful- even more radiant than the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/diathim.md|Diathim]]. Their scaled humanoid bodies are seemingly formed from molten gold, and they possess natural claws, razor-sharp teeth, and horns which contribute to their demonic appearance. Adult Maelibi stand between 2-3 meters in height.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Maelibi age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-19 Years | 20-179 Years | 180-249 Years | 250-299 Years | 300+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Maelibi reside in [Iego](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iego), the "Planet of a Thousand Moons." They live in enormous tunnel systems beneath the surface, which is both a home and a survival tactic.

**Languages:** Maelibi always sing rather than speak, and have extreme difficulty communicating in less-meiotic languages. A Maelibus is incapable of singing [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary) (though they may still learn to understand it).

**Adventurers:** Maelibi are typically isolationists, residing in their burrows with little interest in the outside world. Those who do leave Iego are either youths exploring the great unknown, or exiles fleeing their home.
### Maelibus Species Traits
Maelibi share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Maelibi receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Maelibi are tough and resilient, but have an alien view of life.

- **Hypnotic:** A Maelibus may choose to reroll any [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to activate a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting)*] descriptor, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Primitive:** Maelibi do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** Maelibi can sing, read, and write Maelibi. When learning a new Language, Maelibi continue to communicate in melodic tones.
