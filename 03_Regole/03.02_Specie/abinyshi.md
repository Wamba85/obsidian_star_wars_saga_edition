*Abinyshi Species data created by Wikia user Darthauthor (Converted from its Saga Species Sourcebook counterpart).*

The Abinyshi have played a minor but constant role in galactic history for many centuries. They developed space travel at about the same time as the [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), and though their techniques and technology never compared to that of the Corellians or [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/duros.md|Duros]], they have long enjoyed the technology provided them by their allies. Their small population limited their ability to colonize any territories outside their home system.

The Abinyshi's primary contributions have included culinary and academic developments; several fine restaurants serve Abinyshi cuisine and Abinyshi literature is still devoured by university students throughout the galaxy. The popularity of Abinyshi culture has waned greatly over the past few decades as the Abinyshi traveling the stars slowed to a trickle. Most people believe the Abinyshi destroyed themselves in a cataclysmic civil war.

In truth, the Empire nearly decimated [Inysh](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inysh) and its people. Scouts and Mining Guild officials discovered that [Inysh](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inysh) had massive kalonterium reserves (kalonterium is a low-grade ore used in the development of weapons and some Starship construction). The Imperial mining efforts that followed all but destroyed the [Inysh](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inysh) ecology, and devastated the indigenous flora and fauna.  Mining production slacked off considerably as alternative high-grade ores- like doonium and meleenium- became available in other systems. Eventually, the Imperial mining installation packed up and left the Abinyshi to suffer in their ruined world.

Surprisingly, the Abinyshi have little to say, good or bad, about the Empire, though the Empire has given them plenty of reasons to oppose it. Millennia ago, their culture learned to live with all that the universe presented, and to simply let much of the galaxy's trivial concerns pass them by.
### Abinyshi Characteristics
**Personality:** A gentle people, the Abinyshi take a rather passive view of life. They prefer to let events flow around them rather than take an active role in changing their circumstances. This philosophy has had disastrous consequences for [Inysh](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inysh).

**Physical Description:** The Abinyshi are a short, relatively slender, yellow-green reptilian Species from [Inysh](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inysh). They possess two dark, pupilless eyes that are set close together. Their face has few features aside from a slight horizontal slit of a mouth: their nose and ears, while extant, are very minute and barely noticeable. The Species has a large, two-forked tail that assists in balance and is used both as an appendage and weapon.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Abinyshi age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-15 Years | 16-40 Years | 41-59 Years | 60-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Once a place of beauty and splendor, the Empire stripped [Inysh](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inysh) of its deposits of kalonterium, dumping toxic wastes produced in every conceivable location and left it a ruined world.

**Languages:** Abinyshi speak a strange language also called Abinyshi. Having for long ventured out space they also fluent in Basic.

**Example Names:** Si Qurr, S'itl Thirr, Thi'in Lis.

**Adventurers:** Abinyshi seldom leave their world; continued persecution by the Empire has prompted them to become rather reclusive. Those who do travel tend to stick to regions with relatively light Imperial presence (such as the Corporate Sector or the Periphery) and very rarely discuss anything pertaining to their origin.
### Abinyshi Species Traits
Abinyshi share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Abinyshi receive a +2 bonus to both their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence). Abinyshi have been clever enough to venture to space before the others species but are perceived as weird aliens.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Abinyshi have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Abinyshi have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Cold-Blooded:** An Abinyshi takes a -5 penalty to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) to resist [Extreme Cold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold).
- **Prehensile Tail:** An Abinyshi's tail can effectively hold (but not wield) a Small or smaller item. When holding a Medium or larger item with his or her tail, an Abinyshi is encumbered and is considered to be carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Natural Armor:** Abinyshi have thick scales that provide a +1 Natural Armor bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). A Natural Armor bonus stacks with an Armor bonus.
