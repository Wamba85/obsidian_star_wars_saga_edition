*Didynon Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Didynons are a sentient Species of humanoids covered in calloused white armour plating. They are accomplished miners, with a great deal of expertise in various industrial mining techniques.

The Didynon homeworld of [Didyma V](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Didyma_V) was invaded for its rich reserves of lommite by [The First Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_First_Order), causing many Didynons to take up arms with [The Resistance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Resistance).

### Didynon Characteristics
**Personality:** Didynons often hide a sentimental side behind their tough exteriors. Many have a particular fondness for folk music. Folk-pop hits recorded by Didynons include "*Iego House*" "*Galax-way Girl*" and "*Telepathy Out Loud*."

**Physical Description:** Didynons are humanoid and covered in calloused white armor plating; they can retract their eyes behind these plates for protection, making them very resistant to damage.
