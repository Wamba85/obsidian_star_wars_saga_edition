*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Criminals*

A mammalian Species native to a planet-spanning desert, the H'drachi are well adapted to their environment, able to store water for extended periods of time. The rate of [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] amongst H'drachi on [M'haeli](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/M'haeli) is high, and local Force-users are trained as seers, able to predict brutal sand-storms and act as a living tuning fork. As their culture developed, [The Seers of H'drachi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Seers_of_H'drachi) are able to predict social upheavals as well.
### H'drachi Characteristics
**Personality:** The foresight H'drachi have allows them to maintain a calm and collected outlook in life. This allows them to stave off fear and despair with the knowledge of a better future.

**Physical Description:** Diminutive, fur-covered bipeds, the H'drachi are short-statured mammals with brown hair covering their bodies. Most dress themselves in colorful tunics and turbans.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** H'drachi age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-14 Years | 15-44 Years | 45-69 Years | 70-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [M'haeli](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/M'haeli) is an exploited agriworld in [The Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region) ruled by a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] hegemony of former colonists that conquered the world generations ago.

**Languages:** H'drachi is the local tongue of [M'haeli](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/M'haeli), which sees little use in the wider galaxy.

**Example Names:** Ch'been, Gjon, N'ton, Ph'dan, R'han.

**Adventurers:** The H'drachi are not common among the galaxy's teeming population, although H'drachi spiritualists and producers are prominent on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant). Despite their connection to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), few H'drachi have been members of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) or [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith).
