For several centuries, the galaxy believed the Elomin were the only sentient [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) on the desert world [Elom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)). When the Republic first visited [Elom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)) a century before the rise of the Empire, the Elomin were divided into separate political nations, used internal combustion engines and slug-throwing weaponry, and were barely able to launch satellites into orbit. Blasters, repulsorlifts, and Starships were beyond anything the Elomin had ever imagined. They took quickly to the advanced technology the first-contact specialists chose to share with them. By the time the Galactic Civil War erupted, the Elomin and their world were active participants in the galactic economy.

The world of [Elom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)) is rich in deposits of lommite, a mineral used in the fabrication of transparisteel. Lommite became a sought-after commodity, and the Elomin were canny enough to enter into mining agreements with offworld shipbuilders that would not damage the environment of their world.

Culturally, the Elomin try to discover or create order in all things. They view the universe as a logical, organized puzzle, and endeavor to find the pieces and bring them to their logical places. When confronted with something that doesn't fit into the pattern they have defined, they may try to redefine the pattern, but are just as likely to attempt to ignore the discordant details. Such was the case when the Elomin first discovered the existence of the underground-dwelling [Eloms](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eloms), another sentient [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) native to their world. The Elomin first denied the existence of the [Eloms](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eloms), and then later denied they were sentient. It wasn't until the Republic granted the [Eloms](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eloms) all the rights of sentients under its laws, and the [Eloms](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eloms) helped the Elomin resist Imperial oppression during [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era) that the Elomin fully acknowledged the existence and independence of their neighbors.

### Elomin Characteristics

They get along well with the [Woostoids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Woostoids), and other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) that value logic and order as much as they do, but Elomin consider dealing with [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) and other illogical beings an exercise in frustration.
