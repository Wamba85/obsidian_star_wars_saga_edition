*Reesarian Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Reesarians are a sentient Species of red-skinned humanoids. They have acute senses, with sharp eyesight that allows them to see in infrared and ultraviolet. Their abilities as trackers are second to none; and many an outlaw has met their end at the hands of a gang of Reesarian bounty hunters. The most distinguishing feature of the Reesarians is their ability to form psychic bonds between closely attuned pairs of individuals.

Many Reesarians are valued members of [The Resistance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Resistance). Reesarian [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) were instrumental in scouting the planet [Ajan Kloss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ajan_Kloss), and many Reesarians participated in the final battle against the forces of the reborn [Emperor Palpatine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor_Palpatine).
