The Ssi-Ruuk are warm-blooded reptilian humanoids who command a stellar empire in [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions), well beyond the edges of explored space.

Before [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era), the existence of the Ssi-Ruuk was unknown to the general galactic population. An escalating war with the competing empire of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chiss.md|Chiss]] forced the Ssi-Ruuk to look toward the galactic Core for "Recruits" for their space fleet. The Ssi-Ruuvi forces consisted mostly of self-propelled Battle Droids powered by the life energies and enslaved consciousness of captured humanoids subjected to a process "Entechment."

The Ssi-Ruuk attacked and subjected the citizens of a number of isolated [Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim) settlements before clashing directly with the Empire's fleet. Rather than bringing the full might of the Imperial Navy to bear on the Ssi-Ruuk invaders, the Emperor negotiated to a secret treaty with them. Using prisoners and slaves as some of the raw materials for Battle Droids appealed to the Emperor; in exchange for data on the Ssi-Ruuk entechment process, Palpatine secretly ceded a number of [Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim) systems to the Ssi-Ruuk to do with as they pleased.

One of these star systems was [Bakura](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bakura), a small colony that had been settled by a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] religious fringe group centuries before. While the Emperor saw no value to it, its governor had at his disposal forces that were skilled enough to repel the initial Ssi-Ruuvi strike. The governor sent a desperate message to [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant), notifying them of the unidentified invading force and asking for reinforcements. The message went unanswered by the governor's Imperial masters- but [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) intercepted the message and dispatched a task force to help shortly after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). This represented the first time the factions in the Galactic Civil War would have to declare a temporary truce to deal with an outside threat.

After successfully defeating the Ssi-Ruuvi armada at Bakura, the Alliance mounted an offensive against the Ssi-Ruuk Empire. This led to on-again, off-again diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk, who lacked the resources to wage war on two fronts. Diplomatic talks with the Ssi-Ruuk continue well into [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era), but they have not completely eliminated border skirmishes. Relations with the Ssi-Ruuk remain tense.

Ssi-Ruuk society is split into strict castes. The color of a Ssi-Ruuk's scales usually dictates his or her caste; for example, russet-colored Ssi-Ruuk represent the military caste, gold-scaled Ssi-Ruuk form the religious caste, and sapphire-blue Ssi-Ruuk represent the noble caste. Black-scaled Ssi-Ruuk are usually trained as assassins, while brown-scaled Ssi-Ruuk have no caste whatsoever and are treated as outcasts.

Like many reptilian beings, the Ssi-Ruuk have poor vision but an excellent sense of smell. Their olfactory sense is so fine that they can even ascertain another being's emotional state with a flick of their black tongues.
