*Lizard Warrior Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The Lizard Warriors are a fierce Species of sentient reptilians who live divided between the harsh deserts and submerged caverns on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor). Valuing both martial prowess and hunting skill, Lizard Warriors are careful to mark their borders with totem poles in a symbolic display of [Totem Magic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Totem_Magic). Those Lizard Warriors instead living in large caves have learned to cultivate food pearls from the light of the mysterious Red Pearl. Other members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) terrorize these peaceful settlements, and the more assertive Lizard Warriors are largely ambivalent to their plight.
### Lizard Warrior Characteristics
**Personality:** Lizard Warriors are sharply divided between the desert and underwater dwellers; the former is martial culture that valuing warfare and hunting while the latter is generally welcoming and hospitable to "surface dwellers" despite the encroaching threats around them.

**Physical Description:** Lizard Warriors are humanoid reptiles with a row of yellow spikes running from the crown of their heads to the tip of the tail. They are covered in green scales with a yellow underbelly, with pointed snout full of sharp teeth.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Lizard Warriors age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-14 Years | 15-49 Years | 50-44 Years | 45-54 Years | 55+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Lizard Warriors live both in the inhospitable deserts and the underwater grottos of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

**Languages:** Saurian is a hissing tone that travels well in the acid deserts and the underwater oceans. As the [Gorphs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gorphs) are the only notable member of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) to be similarly aquatic, most Lizard Warriors also take the time to learn Gorphese.

**Example Names:** Dracos, Joddar, Orcon, Squik.

**Adventurers:** The divide between desert and underwater Lizard Warriors makes them equally likely to take the roles of any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class), though martial Lizard Warriors are much more likely to hail from their desert tribes.
