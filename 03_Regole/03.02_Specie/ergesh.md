*Ergesh Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Aliens Stats counterpart).*

One of the few sapient Species in the galaxy that evolved from plant-based organisms, The Ergesh of [The Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region) planet [Ergeshui](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ergeshui) resemble mounds of plant material with a variety of appendages. Ergesh do not have faces in the accepted sense of the word. A number of the smaller tentacles actually are optic stalks, the Ergesh equivalent of eyes, while others are sensitive to sound waves.

When Ergesh get angry, they quake and begin to make gargling noises. They are poor combatants, their most effective attack is to simply trample over their opponents. Due to their massive bulk (An adult Ergesh weighs half a metric ton), this crude tactic is extremely effective against foes [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]-sized and smaller. The major drawback of this attack is that the Ergesh must be close to their opponent to begin with, as they are not swift enough to catch a fleeing foe.

Once per year, there comes a day when both moons are aligned in a certain way, with devastating effects on the Ergesh. During this period, the Ergesh act irrational, violent, even insane. It is almost as if the Ergesh are intoxicated. This day is called he "Bad Water Pull," and all offworlders are encouraged to stay clear of the native population until the madness passes.

Ergesh are divided into clans, which have formed a federation that rules the planet. The eldest Ergesh from each clan is part of the governing body. This government meets monthly in the Communal Pool. The Ergesh federation has ties with [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance), and occasionally harbors Rebel fugitives.

The Ergesh specialize in organic machines, most of them "Grown" in the area called the "Industrial Swampfields." Ergesh machinery is a fusion of plant matter and manufactured materials. This equipment cannot be deprived of moisture for more than one standard hour, or it ceases to function properly. Even Ergesh buildings are organic, and some are semi-sentient. No locks are needed on the dilating doors because the buildings know who they belong to. Ergesh buildings have ramps instead of stairs- indeed, stairs are unheard of, and there is no such word in the native language.

### Ergesh Characteristics

**Personality:** Ergesh are boisterous, curious, and rather naive. They are social beings, greatly prizing friends and "Family." Despite their fearsome appearance, they are not violent. Unfortunately, Ergesh have yet to become accustomed to all of the diverse [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) of the galaxy. To Ergesh, [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) are an "Unfathomable Alien Species." In their dealings with one another, Ergesh are honest and fair. Theirs is a society with no classes, no discrimination, and no wants.

**Physical Description:** The average Ergesh stands two meters tall and resembles a rounded heap of moving plant matter. Its body is covered with drooping, slimy appendages that range from two centimeters to three meters in length, and from one millimeter to five centimeters in width. Ergesh coloration is a blend of green, brown, and gray. The younger Ergesh have more green, the elders more brown. A strong smell of ammonia and rotting vegetation follows an Ergesh wherever it goes. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ergesh age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-29 Years | 30-129 Years | 130-169 Years | 170-199 Years | 200+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Ergesh are native to [Ergeshui](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ergeshui), an oppressively hot and humid world. There is no crime on [Ergeshui](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ergeshui), as property is communal to be shared each according to their own needs. The sole settlement is Offworlder City, built more or less along conventional lines.

**Languages:** Ergesh communicate using sound-based speech. Their voices sound like thick mud coming to a rapid boil. In fact, many Ergesh- especially those that deal most with offworlders- speak rather good Basic, though it sounds as if the speaker is talking underwater. Due to how they perceive and understand the world around them, they often omit personal pronouns (I, Me) and articles (A, The). Most small words in the Ergesh tongue are represented by vocal inflections.

**Example Names:** Ergesh personal names are long affairs, with many odd bubbling noises included. The Ergesh tolerate being given nicknames by offworlders that they are dealing with.

**Adventurers:** Ergesh are not hesitant about traveling into space. They wear special belts that not only produce a nitrogen field that allows them to breathe, but also retains the vast majority of their moisture. The Ergesh travel in living spaceships called *Starjumpers*.
