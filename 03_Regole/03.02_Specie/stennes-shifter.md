*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Species Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Species_Sourcebook)*

If any [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) was deserving of the fear and prejudice that marks shape-shifters, then it is the Stennes Shifters. Like other shape-shifters, there is very little known about the Stennes Shifters, save that it is a genetic offshoot of the [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) Stennes race. Ancient records indicate that more was known about the Species in the ancient past of the Republic, but those records are incomplete and largely incomprehensible.

The Jedi Knights of 5,000 years ago faced the Stennes Shifters, and recognized them as a threat. The records indicate that [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) of that era decimated the Species, and today estimates place the Stennes Shifter population anywhere from several million to less than a thousand.

Legend tells of the dangers of the Stennes Shifters. These beings have been alternatively named "Force-eaters," due to their eerie natural abilities. The Stennes Shifters have a bizarre sensitivity to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). This in itself is not unheard of, as the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gotal.md|Gotal]] and non-sentient [Vornskr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vornskr) have a limited natural sensitivity to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). However, the Stennes Shifters' ability to use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) is possibly unique.

Stennes Shifters draw power from expended Force energy. If those within the vicinity alter the flow of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) around them, the Stennes Shifters gain its energy. Furthermore, legends state that Stennes Shifters can tap the stored Force within unwary beings, like the vampires that lurk in the mythologies of many cultures.

No known Stennes Shifter has ever been medically examined in recent history, so whether these powers are true or only wild conjecture is unknown. The standard Stennes shows no exotic physiological developments that would suggest these abilities.

The Stennes Shifters' shifting ability is not based on physical change, but on telepathic manipulation. Whether this is a Force-based ability is unknown. It is known that this ability does not extend to mechanical optical devices, like photoreceptors and holocams. The Stennes Shifter appears in its normal form: a slight humanoid with grayish skin and a sunken, skull-like face.
### Stennes Shifter Characteristics
**Personality:** The Stennes [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) are a xenophobic lot, as millenia of persecution has ensured that many non-Shifters have been killed. While the Stenne Shifters avoid contact with the outsiders, they are generally sociable friendly with those they are close with.

**Physical Description:** The Stennes Shifters are biological offshoots of the [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) Stennes and resemble their kin in appearance, with ashen-gray skin riddled with dark veins and small knobs, a slight body, heavy-lidded eyes, and gaunt cheeks that gave them a skull-like visage.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Stennes Shifters age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-19 Years | 20-149 Years | 150-299 Years | 300-499 Years | 500+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Stennes Shifters' homeworld of [Stennaros](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stennaros) is a world pock-marked with artillery craters, and the scars of years of persecution.

**Languages:** Stennes Shifters speak an old language called Stennesian. Most of them have also learned to speak Basic.

**Example Names:** Trinto Duaba, Braconnor Bakiska.

**Adventurers:** The few Stennes Shifters that exist today do their best to remain hidden, only using their powers when absolutely necessary and posing as normal Stennes. Those who cannot assimilate into society blend into crowds, earning a living as thieves, spies, or informants.
### Stennes Shifter Species Traits
Stennes Shifters share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Stennes Shifters receive a +2 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Stennes Shifters seem frightening and suspicious, and constantly find themselves persecuted, hunted, and- when discovered- killed.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Stennes Shifters have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Stennes Shifters have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bonus Class Skill:** [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) is always considered a Class Skill for Stennes Shifters.
- **Energy Drain:** As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per round, a Stennes Shifter can drain energy from a [Grabbed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grabbed) target, moving the target -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) as a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition), and granting the Stennes Shifter [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) equal to 5 + half the Stennes Shifter's Character Level.
    - The Stennes Shifter can repeat this action each round until the target escapes the [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab), or until the target is rendered unconscious. If the target survives the draining attempt, the [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) is removed after the target rests for 8 hours.
- **Sneaky:** A Stennes Shifter can choose to reroll any [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check to [Sneak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak), but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Stennes Shifters can speak, read, and write both Basic and Stennesian.
