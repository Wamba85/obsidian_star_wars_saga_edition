*Nobillian Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Nobillians are a somewhat short species of pink insectoids. Often considered good-looking, these insectoids have such a good eye for fashion that they are more commonly referred to by the moniker of "Glambugs". Glambug models can often be found on the catwalk or on the arm of a wealthy executive, but [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) offers few such opportunities, and most earn a living in decidedly less than glamorous ways.
### Nobillian Characteristics
**Personality:** Nobillians are often sarcastic and prone to vicious insults, but this belies the deep love and respect they hold for those close to them.

**Physical Description:** Nobillians are an insectoid species with pink exoskeletons and antennae. Smaller than other humanoids, Nobillians' fashion sense typically has them in classy attire in even the most drab of occupations.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Nobillians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-22 Years | 23-44 Years | 45-60 Years | 61-80 Years | 81+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Though rare, Nobillians can be found all across [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim), from [Batuu](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Batuu) to [Cantonica](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cantonica).

**Language:** Nobillians speak both their own language and are fluent in Basic.

**Example Names:** Meebin, Neeva, Skeebus, Zarry.

**Adventurers:** Nobillians can be of any class, but are most often [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).
### Nobillian Species Traits
Nobillians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Nobillians receive a +2 bonus to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Glambugs are fashionable and well-liked, but lacking in physical endurance.
- **Medium Size:** As medium creatures, Nobillians have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Nobillians have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Energy Surge:** Once per encounter, a Nobillian can gain a temporary boost to quickness and reflexes. When this ability is activated as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), a Glambug gains a +2 bonus on [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity)-based [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks), and increases its base speed to 8 squares.
    - The energy lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Nobillian's [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier (minimum 1 round). When the energy is expended, the Glambug moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
    - The penalties imposed by this condition persist until the Nobillian takes at least 10 minutes to recuperate, during which time the creature can't engage in any strenuous activity.
- **Heightened Awareness:** A Nobillian may choose to reroll any [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Nobillian can speak, read, and write Basic and Nobillian.
