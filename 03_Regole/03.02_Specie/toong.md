*Toong Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

When Old Republic scouts first made contact with the Toong, the Species was in the early stages of explorationing their solar system. The appearance of alien beings in ships with technology beyond anything the Toong had imagined threw their planet into chaos. The revelation triggered a war between many of their homeworld's nations. Covert observation of the Species by first-contact specialists assigned to the scouting mission indicated that the Toong were a peaceful and outgoing Species, so the panic and violence that followed first contact came as a complete shock to the scouts. It took weeks to reestablish contact with the Toong, and only then did Republic diplomats and scouts realize they had overlooked something: although highly evolved mentally, the Toong Species retains a keen fight-or-flight instinct that frequently manifests as acute social anxiety. The sudden appearance of strange beings from the stars caused mass panic. A tremendous effort on the part of the first-contact team and Jedi Councilors hastily dispatched from [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) prevented massive warfare that would have destroyed Toong society.

Once the Toong became comfortable with the idea of being part of a great galactic community, they united under a single planetary government and joined [The Old Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic). They took quickly to the more advanced technology; within a few centuries after contact, Toong bases and settlements could be found throughout the Toong'L System.

The Toong reluctantly expanded beyond their own star system, giving rise to scattered colonies throughout the galaxy. These colonies are typically organized around mining or farming efforts, and the Toong colonists enjoy minimal contact with other sentient [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). A few rare Toong work outside the Toong'L System or its colonies as accountants, mechanics, or even scouts and bounty hunters, but more often than not, they gravitate to positions where they don't have to interact with others.

Visitors to Toong'L are often surprised to learn that rocket-jumping, Podracing, and aircar demolition debris are favorite pastimes among the Toong. Further, many raiders who felt Toong ships or communities would be easy targets for piracy realized Toong fight back if forced into a corner by excessive demands or obvious threats to their livelihood.
### Toong Characteristics
**Personality:** Toong exhibit extreme nervousness in social situations. They invariably give in whenever challenged vocally or physically, particularly when facing non-Toong. A typical Toong feels safe only with his or her immediate family. This has caused most other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to view the Toong as cowards, but they do not fear combat and other dangerous situations. Rather, they dread face-to-face interaction with other beings.

**Physical Description:** The Toong have long thin legs, no neck, and bulbous bodies. Their eyes are set high on their slightly pointed heads, allowing for excellent peripheral vision, and their jowled cheeks can expand to store food (a legacy from the hairless rodents from which the Species evolved). Adult Toong stand between 1.6 and 2.4 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Toong age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-19 Years | 20-48 Years | 49-72 Years | 73-97 Years | 98+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Toong'L](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Toong'L), located in [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories). Shortly before the Invasion of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo), the Toong are forced to the nearby world of [Tund](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tund) after [Toong'L](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Toong'L) is devastated by comet impacts.

**Languages:** Toong speak and read Toongese. When forced into a confrontation with unfamiliar beings, a Toong frequently stutters nervously.

**Example Names:** Ben Quadinaros, Derble Fonkin, Glef Wonkitz, Hyke Waulkon, Tigona Minamore.

**Adventurers:** Toong heroes can belong to any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class), although their discomfort with social situations makes them poor [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles).
