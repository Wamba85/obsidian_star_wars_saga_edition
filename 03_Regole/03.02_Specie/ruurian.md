*Ruurian Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Ruurians are a small caterpillarlike Species known in the Corporate Sector for their scholarly achievements and their linguistic ability. They hatch from eggs as larvae and immediately enter the workforce, caring for their elders, manufacturing goods, and running Ruuria's government. After years spent as larvae, a Ruurian enters the pupa stage, emerging from its chrysalis as a butterflylike Chroma-Wing. Chroma-Wings are concerned only with mating, eating, and sleeping, leaving societal matters to the younger generation.

Due to high intelligence and natural talent for learning languages, Ruurian larvae find work throughout the galaxy as diplomats and instructors. Many Ruurians demonstrate impressive artistic skills as well, becoming renowned musicians, architects, and designers.

### Ruurian Characteristics
**Personality:** Larval Ruurians are the most commonly encountered members of their species. They are sensitive, thoughtful, and responsible beings. Chroma-Wings lose much of their intellectual acuity, are generally shy or aloof, and grow increasingly lazy over time, as all of their needs are seen to by their larval offspring.

**Physical Description:** Ruurians are arthropedal beings with long tubular bodies, red multifaceted eyes, feathery antennae, and fur marked with red-brown rings. The average Ruurian larvae stands about 1.1 meters tall. Ruurian Chroma-Wings also have bright, colorful wings.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ruurians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-11 Years | 12-34 Years | 35-42 Years | 43-49 Years | 50+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Ruuria](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ruuria) is a warm, humid jungle world near the Corporate Sector. It boasts some of the finest institutes of higher learning, which specializes in intellectual sciences such as mathematics, physics, and philosophy.

**Languages:** Ruurese is an elegant language with sounds typical of many other languages. Written Ruurese consists of a complicated swirl of lines, all drawn at varying angles. Ruurians are adept at learning new languages and capable of a wider range of vocalizations than most [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**Example Names:** Amisus, Bivikorn Phaanan, Bufaali, Laalu Daorjay, Reeor, Skynx, Tuur Raarbossi, Vobaa Eelunri.

**Adventurers:** Ruurians excel as ambassadors, scientists, and musicians. Ruurian heroes are typically [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) or [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians), although they can pursue any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class).
