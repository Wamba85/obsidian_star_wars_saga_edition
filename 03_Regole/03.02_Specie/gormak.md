*Gormak Species data created by reddit user robanglican.*
An aggressive Species of humanoids found exclusively on the world of [Voss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Voss_(Planet)), the Gormak have an amazing ability to comprehend highly advanced technology and adapt it to their specific needs. From bits of scavenged electronics and discarded equipment, they can construct tools, machinery, and even deadly weapons and cybernetic implants.

Aside from their affinity for technology, the Gormak's most notable feature is their hatred of the [Voss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Voss) Species (and by extension, Force-sensitives). The Gormak view the [Voss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Voss) as abominations that must be purged from their homeworld, and they are quick to extend this animosity to newcomers from both the Republic and the Empire- like the [Voss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Voss), these newcomers are all "Outsiders."

The Gormak population is estimated to be in the millions, spread across the planet, but so far their tribal, warlike nature has kept them from uniting against the [Voss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Voss). Over the centuries, the [Voss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Voss) have had to constantly fight against the Gormak to survive- and developed a hatred just as strong as the Gormak's.
