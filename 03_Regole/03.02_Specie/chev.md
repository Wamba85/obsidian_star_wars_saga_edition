*Chev Species data created by Wikia user Jdborghetti (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Chevs are a Near-Human [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) native to the world of [Vinsoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vinsoth), where they live in small farming and manufacturing communities scattered across the planet's surface. With the exception of a few bands of rebels that hide in the world's mountains, all Chevs are slaves of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]], the pachydermoid Species with whom they share the world. The Chev villages are all surrounded by mine fields and fences intended to protect the Chevs from predators and banish any thoughts of escape.

Millennia ago, the Chevs lived in grand cities, but the more aggressive [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] shattered their peaceful civilization. Chev communities exist primarily to supply food and manufactured goods for their nomadic masters, although they are permitted to trade goods between villages. They have a rich culture, filled with folklore, a wide range of musical, dramatic, and artistic forms of expression, and religious traditions. The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] have never made any effort to discourage the Chevs from practicing their cultural rites within the boundaries of their settlements, as the overlords find the activities interesting to watch and believe it helps increase the productivity of the slaves. Also, aspects of Chev religious beliefs exist that the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] find suits their purposes- such as ancient myths describing how the Chevs would be enslaved as punishment for their pride in their great cities, Other beliefs are less appreciated by the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]]- such as the tales that some day the Chevs will be delivered from their bondage and rise to rule all space- but the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] are willing to take the bad with the good. Further, a number of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] masters have discovered offworld markets for the more impressive Chev artistic works. Some [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] have even managed to sell Chev theater troupes at "Group Rates."

Unlike many other slave populations, the Chevs are well educated and as informed about the galaxy at large as their [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] masters, perhaps even more so.

The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] have always taken relatively good care of the Chevs because they believe healthy, bright, and happy slaves are more efficient than starved, illiterate and rebellious ones. The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] pass virtually every bit of knowledge they gain about the galaxy at large, including technology- with the exception of repulsorlifts, comlinks, and weaponry- to their slaves.

One drawback to the Chevin's permissive attitudes toward Chev culture, at least from the point of view of oppressive slave masters, is that they remain unaware of high-tech rebel movements within Chev villages. Like the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]], the Chevs take quickly to advanced technology and secretly build communications devices, jamming devices, sensors and weapons from parts stolen from farming equipment or [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] communities. Although the seeds of rebellion are first planted during the time of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic), it isn't until [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era) that organized offworlders begin helping the Chevs expand their network of rebels.

All Chevs encountered off [Vinsoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vinsoth) are either current or former slaves. When the Republic contacted the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]], they almost instantly started exporting their slave population, either to other slavers or to [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] colonies offworld. Most Chevs prefer to remain low-key and avoid political entanglements for fear of being recaptured by wandering [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]].

### Chev Characteristics
**Personality:** The Chevs are not a broken people, despite their apparent subservience to the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]]. Their passive, compliant behavior belies a sly craftiness and firm resolve. Centuries of slavery have made the Chevs protective of their cultural heritages as well as forced them to become highly adaptive. Chevs know that they will overthrow their masters some day, but until that day comes, they remain patient and guarded.

**Physical Description:** Chev skin color ranges from pale white to slate grey, with hair colors displaying similar varieties (rare Chevs have wheat-colored hair). They have sloping foreheads with pronounced brows and large, black eyes that appear lidless. (They do in fact have transparent membranes that can cover the eyes to protect and clean them.) Chevs usually dress in simple, sturdy garments but wear whatever style of clothing seems most practical for their line of work. They are shorter on average than baseline [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), standing 1.4 to 1.8 meters tall. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Chevs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-13 Years | 14-18 Years | 19-40 Years | 41-62 Years | 63-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Vinsoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vinsoth), a temperate and verdant world located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim)- a world they share with the pachydermoid [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]].

**Languages:** All Chevs speak Basic in addition to their own language and that of the Chevin; their masters encourage the Chevs to practice the galactic tongue to make them more useful and easier to sell to offworlders.

**Example Names:** Afrec, Amencia, Brophar, Inchef, Percifel, Sajan, Varel, Zethan.

**Adventurers:** Chev adventurers are typically [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians). While it is possible for Chevs to master [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chevin.md|Chevin]] would take a dim view of anyone who undertook such activities.
