*Lasat Species data created by TheSagaContinues users Droidscotty and RogerWilco.*

Lasats are a humanoid sentient Species native to the Outer Rim world of [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan), though the Species originated from the [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space) planet [Lira San](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lira_San). They were thought to have been driven to the brink of extinction when [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan) was devastated by [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Galactic_Empire), but there were actually millions living on their true, isolated homeworld. Lasats were notable for their impressive height, strength, and agility, with their muscular digitigrade legs enabling them to run faster, jump higher and farther, and move more quietly than [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans).
### Lasat Characteristics
**Personality:** Within the Species, those with fighting skills were highly respected, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard, a group of highly trained, highly intelligent warriors sworn to protect their homeworld of [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan). [Bo-Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bo-Rifles) were a long-standing tradition in Lasat culture, used exclusively by the Honor Guard of [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan). The warrior way of the Lasat was the *Boosahn Keeraw*. When a Lasat was bested by a superior opponent in combat, they would give them their weapon.

**Physical Description:** A typical Lasat had the strength to open a powered-down blast door. A height of two meters tall was considered below-average for a Lasat. The fur patterns of a Lasat varied from individual to individual, and could change suddenly as they aged. Some [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) considered a Lasat's strong odor unbearably offensive. Facial hair is an important status symbol in Lasat culture. Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes are considered to be attractive by others of their [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Lasats age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-17 Years | 18-44 Years | 45-69 Years | 70-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** While the Lasat originated from the planet [Lira San](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lira_San) hidden in [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space), for unknown reasons the majority of Lasats migrated to [Lasan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lasan) during the time of the Old Republic.

**Languages:** The Lasat spoke Lasat, a language whose *r*<nowiki/>'s were difficult to replicate by most other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**Example Names:** Boscoface, Chava, Davin, Gron, Garazeb Orrelios.

**Adventurers:** Following the fall of Lasan, very few Lasats were left in the galaxy, and of those who survived, most were enslaved by the Empire. Those who become adventurers are almost exclusively [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), with a few becoming [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), and the rare [Force Prodigy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigy) typically became a tribal mystic.
### Lasat Species Traits
Lasats share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Lasats receive a +2 bonus to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Lasats are tough and strong, but are often tactless and practical.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Lasats have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Lasats have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Lasat's leg structure allows them to propel themselves upwards with ease. A Lasat with [Jump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jump) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Jump)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Jump)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Expert Climber:** Lasats are great climbers and may choose to [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on [Climb](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climb) checks even when distracted or threatened.
- **Low-Light Vision:** Lasats ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (but not [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness.
- **Weapon Familiarity:** Lasats treat the [Bo-Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bo-Rifle) as a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle) instead of an [Exotic Weapon (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Ranged)).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Lasats can speak, read, and write both Basic and Lasat.
