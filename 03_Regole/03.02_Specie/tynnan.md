*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

Tynnans are water-loving aliens that have long been integrated into galactic civilization. They have poor eyesight, but good strength and remarkable stamina. As aquatic animals, they can hold their breath for extended periods.

Tynnans were blessed with a world rich in natural and mineral resources. The Tynnans have been made wealthy by the development of their world, made possible with the aid of conglomerates in the Republic. The Tynnans are determined to protect their world, which remains pristine.

This wealth doesn't mean that all Tynnans are wealthy. What it does mean is that the entire Species is supported by an extensive state-run society. Nearly all amenities, including housing, food, education, and entertainment, are free of charge.

The Tynnans have an equal and enlightened society. Great efforts are made to allow individuals to pursue their own objectives without infringing on the rights of others; Tynnans are instructed to take responsibility for their own actions and have worked to create a safe, fair world. All Tynnan citizens are recognized as equals before the law. Tynnans are an extremely pragmatic people, not given to religion or mythology.

### Tynnan Characteristics
**Personality:** Many assume that the Tynnans' love of play makes them weak-willed, shortsighted, and lazy; nothing could be further from the truth. Tynnans will plan most things down to the most minute detail.

**Physical Description:** Tynnans are short, furry mammals who spend nearly as much time in the frigid waters of their planet as they do on land. A thick layer of blubber insulates them from temperature shock and gives them an innocuous, chubby appearance that belies their fierce intelligence.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Tynnans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-13 Years | 14-19 Years | 20-69 Years | 70-94 Years | 95-122 Years | 123+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Tynnan government reinvests the profits from its refineries and processing plants. As a result, [Tynna](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tynna) has, being for being, one of the wealthiest populations in the galaxy.

**Languages:** Having long since integrated into galaxy society, Tynnans learn Basic at a young age. Their native language of Tynnan is still used primarily on [Tynna](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tynna) and local systems.

**Example Names:** Bowspritz, Cham Teleus, Dawson, Nog Teleus, Odumin, Razelfiin, Saltbite, Streamdrinker.

**Adventurers:** Many Tynnans work to earn their living standards, and many devote themselves to the arts and sciences. Some live happy lives of leisure and exploration. Tourism is one of their many pastimes, and Tynnans can be found throughout the galaxy on tours, trips, and expeditions.
