*Jinda Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The Jindas on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) are nomads, roaming between far-flung settlements under the name "The Travelling Jindas," entertaining sentients and non-sentients alike. It is both a blessing and a curse that the Jindas have such a poor direction sense- they may avoid trouble by not running into a hostile [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/dulok.md|Dulok]] tribe more than once, but they have extreme difficulty finding the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), who are their favourite audience. [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) have dubbed this faulty orientation "The Curse of the Jindas," and the moon's few nomadic tribes are sometimes referred to as Jindas by more traditional [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) disdainful of their peripatetic lifestyle. The Jindas have no real enemies and sometimes act as neutral message-carriers between Endor's warring [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). 

Entertainment is the basis of Jinda society, each holding an inborn performance skill, such as juggling, magic, dancing, or music. Their poor long-term memory is actually a storytelling asset, for their unintentional embellishments make the tales more entertaining. Despite the Species' propensity for exaggeration, a Jinda story always contains a grain of truth. 

Jinda chroniclers claim that their people once had a stable agricultural settlement on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). According to the tale, a mysterious, Force-strong "rock wizard" grew angry with them and decreed they would never again settle down in one place.

### Jinda Characteristics
**Personality:** Jindas are jovial, exuberant beings who have a playful attitude towards life and love to entertain others; they always have a smile for strangers but suffer from a terrible sense of direction. 

**Physical Description:** Jindas vary from slender to rotund, but even the fattest are filled with boundless energy. All Jindas have red pom-pom tufts of hair and black noses. If threatened, or when impressing females, male Jindas can balloon out their red-banded necks to make them seem larger than they are. Their blunt, cube-shaped teeth and large mouths make it clear that the Jindas are herbivores and love nothing more than a good meal. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Jindas age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-18 Years | 19-49 Years | 50-74 Years | 75-89 Years | 90+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Jindas crashed on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) aboard the colony ship *Free Enterprise*, and have optimistically made the best out of an unfortunate situation.

**Languages:** Old Jinda has its roots offworld, but its people's nomadic nature makes it an important trade language on the Forest Moon.

**Example Names:** Bondo, Chituhr, Maknar, Prekblu, Trebla.

**Adventurers:** The nomadic nature of Jindas make them frequent travelers of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), always showing up in the most remote of places. These beings are typically [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) to make the most of their social skills, with a handful acting as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) despite their terrible senses of direction.
### Jinda Species Traits
Jindas share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Jindas receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Jindas practice several kinds of acrobatic acts, but they suffer from a terrible sense of direction.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Jindas have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Jindas have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bonus Trained Skill:** Jindas have a natural talent for performative skills. A Jinda character chooses one additional [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) at 1st level. The [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) must be chosen from the character's list of Class Skills.
- **Musical Obfuscation:** A Jinda can reroll any [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check to convey [Deceptive Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deceptive_Information), keeping the better of the two results. A Jinda can project their sounds out to a range of 10 squares.
    - As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), a Jinda can [Create a Diversion to Hide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Create_a_Diversion_to_Hide).
- **Primitive:** Jindas do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Wild Luck:** Once per encounter, a Jinda may choose to reroll any skill check or attack roll, keeping the better result. However, their next roll of a Natural 20 is instead treated as if they had rolled a Natural 1. Additionally, Jindas never benefit from competence bonuses to [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) checks made to [Know Direction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Know_Direction).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Jindas can speak, read, and write Old Jinda. They can also speak Ewokese.
