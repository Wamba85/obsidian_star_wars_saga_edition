*Gigoran Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Gigorans are a tall bipedal species that evolved from social, troglodytic primates on the mountainous world of Gigor.
### Gigoran Characteristics
**Personality:** Despite their fearsome appearances, most Gigorans are peaceful and friendly. When pressed into a dangerous situation, however, they become savage adversaries. Individuals are extremely loyal and affectionate toward family and friends, and have been known to sacrifice themselves for the safety of their loved ones. They are also curious beings, especially with respect to items of high technology. These "shiny baubles" are often taken by naive Gigorans, ignorant of the laws of the galaxy forbidding such acts.

**Physical Description:**  Gigorans are well-muscled, with long sinuous limbs ending in huge, paw-like, padded hands and feet. They are covered in pale fur. Due to their appearance, they are often confused with other, similar species such as the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/wookiee.md|Wookiees]]. They typically range from 2 to 2.5 meters in height.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Gigorans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-17 Years | 18-200 Years | 201-250 Years | 251-299 Years | 300+ Years |

**Homeworld:** An unremarkable ice planet by most accounts, the frigid world of [Gigor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gigor) was known to the galaxy long before the Gigorans were discovered.

**Language:** Gigorans are capable of learning and speaking Basic, but most speak their native tongue, a strange mixture of creaks, groans, grunts, whistles, and chirps which often sounds unintelligible even to translator droids. In order to communicate with species that do not speak their language, Gigorans often wear translating vocoders on their mouths to speak other languages besides Gigoran.

**Example Names:** Baheeoo, Basha, Bunt, Chamdaka, Fess, Kantuck, Moroff, Oo'ob, Purpruff, Rollos, Senna, Sluncan, Ymmoss

**Adventurers:** Gigorans make especially good [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi), and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).
