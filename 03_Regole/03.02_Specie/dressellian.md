*Dressellian Species data created by Wikia user Jdborghetti (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Two hundred years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), Dresselians were simple hunters foraging for food in the wild. Two centuries later, they'd evolved into a burgeoning industrial-level society with a loose coalition government. The Empire gave a choice: slavery or death. To the Empire's surprise, many Dressellians chose death, albeit in combat. The [Bothans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothans) supplied the Dressellian resistance with weapons, and sheer defiance and tenacity allowed the "Primitive Alien Scum" to drive back the Imperial invaders of their world.

Dressellians joined with [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) shortly before the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), and since then members of the Species have been spotted in every corner of the civilized galaxy. [Dressel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dressel) joined [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) shortly after the Empire's defeat, although it usually takes some coaxing by the [Bothans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothans) to get them to care about matters affecting the galaxy at large. 

The Yuuzhan Vong Invasion has stoked the Dressellian passion for freedom. Dressellians everywhere, from lone tramp freighter pilots to the stalwart defenders of [Dressel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dressel), oppose these galactic oppressors at every turn by helping to evacuate or defend Republic colonies.

### Dressellian Characteristics
**Personality:** Dressellians are fiercely independent loners by nature. Their early encounter with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) (Such as the [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire)) have made a lasting impression, and they are generally wary of "Outlanders." Most Dressellians have a high regard for [Bothans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothans), however, given the two Species shared history of peace. Although self-serving and quick to anger, Dressellians are loyal to others who have aided them and asked for nothing in return.

**Physical Description:** Dressellians have elongated hairless heads, wrinkled flesh, and wiry bodies. The average Dressellian stands about 1.8 meters tall. Their wrinkled skin has earned them the callous nickname "Prune Face," to which all Dressellians take offense. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Dressellians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-14 Years | 15-45 Years | 46-59 Years | 60-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Dressel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dressel) is a temperate Mid Rim world rich in natural resources. [Bothans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothans) explorers discovered it shortly before the dissolution of the Republic and chose not to interfere with the Dressellians, who were, at the time, a hunting-and-gathering society. The [Bothans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothans) colonized a nearby asteroid belt instead, by the time the Empire occupied [Dressel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dressel), the Dressellians had developed industrial-level technology-steam-powered machines, slugthrowers, and so on.

**Language:** Dressellians speak Dressellese, a simple language that's evolved over millennia. As Dressellian and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/bothan.md|Bothan]] relations improved, many Bothese terms found their way into the Dressellese language. Since the yoke of Imperial oppression has been lifted from Dressel, the Dressellians have adopted the Bothese alphabet over their more archaic symbol-based system for written Dressellese.

**Example Names:** Dreefa, Errillan, Leerayen, Orrimaarko, Parskeer, Pyrroon Nox, Reeft, Tremorra.

**Adventurers: **Dressellians prefer the comforts of home to wandering the galaxy. With the formation of [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), much of the prejudice against Dressellians has disappeared, and they have begun to roam the galaxy in search of adventure. Dressellian heroes are most commonly [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels). Dressellian Force-users are very rare.
### Dressellian Species Traits
Dressellians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers: **All Dressellians receive a +2 bonus to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Dressellians are hardy and spirited, but have little interest in others.
- **Medium Size: **As Medium creatures, Dressellians have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Dressellians have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Fearless:** Dressellians gain a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) to resist both Fear effects, as well as the [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) application of the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) Skill.
- **Low-Tech Aptitude:** Whenever a Dressellian armed with an slugthrower weapon successfully damages a target, the Dressellian adds their entire Character Level to the damage total instead of half.
- **Automatic Language: **All Dressellians can speak, read, and write Dressellese. After the fall of the Empire, Dressellese are also fluent in Bothese.
