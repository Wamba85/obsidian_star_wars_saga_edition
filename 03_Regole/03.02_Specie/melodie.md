*Melodie Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker.*

The Melodies are a humanoid water-based Species native to [Yavin 8](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin_8). They live deep within the purple mountains of their homeworld, most notably Sistra Mountain.

Melodies are hatched from eggs and started life on land. These young Melodies live around the underground freshwater lakes deep within the caverns and inlets of the moon's equatorial mountain ranges until they reached the age of 20, when they complete the change into an Adult Melodie (also known as an Elder) in an event called the Changing Ceremony.

During the Changing Ceremony, these Melodies (also known as Changelings) are taken down a shallow cove to begin their transformation from land-dweller to water-breather. This shallow cove is the only safe place the Ceremony can take place. It is covered in a blue-green algae which creates oxygen through photosynthesis for the Changelings to breathe.

### Melodie Characteristics
**Personality:** Melodies are strict and mature, forced to be responsible for the younger generations due to the parents residing in the ocean. They have been known to show kindness, attempting to shelter refugee [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]] fleeing [Yavin 4](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin_4).

**Physical Description:** In their youth, Melodies appear have an appearance similar to [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans), albit with yellow eyes and webbed hands. Adult Melodies share their upper body appearance with their youth, but possess a long-fightlike tail in place of their lower body.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Melodies age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-19 Years | 20-44 Years | 45-54 Years | 55-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Melodies reside on the mountainous ocean moon of [Yavin 8](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin_8), revolving around the gas giant of Yavin in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** Melodies possess their own language of Melodese, a language of perpetual humming so as to travel underwater.
