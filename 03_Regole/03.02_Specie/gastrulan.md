*Gastrulan Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty.*Encountered by Bungo Bung, a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/sullustan.md|Sullustan]] freighter captain, during the Galactic Civil War, the Gastrulans are primitive gastropods in [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories) on the musky world of [Gastrula](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gastrula). While not ignorant of the greater galaxy, few Gastrulans had reason to leave their homeworld except for trade (Gastrulans have an acute sense of taste, creating a great demand for unusual foodstuffs).

Due to their gastropod nature slowing their movement, Gastrulans have evolved an unusual method of locomotion by rolling their shells like a wheel. Gastrulans are hermaphrodites and lay eggs to multiply, but uniquely are unable to reproduce without a partner. The very concept of gender seems to them as strange as it is incongruous. Gastrulans particularly appreciate humid environments and find arid or grainy places inhospitable.

### Gastrulan Characteristics
**Personality:** Gastrulans are slow to act, even compared to the patient [Kitonaks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kitonaks). Making a decision takes more than a considerable amount of time for them because each item must be carefully weighed. Gastrulans are not zealous or courageous, prefering to retract within their shells and wait for the danger to pass.

**Physical Description:** Standing around 1.5 meters in height, Gastrulans possess four short arms attached to their torsos ending in paddlelike hands with opposable thumbs. Their heads are bulbous, with a thin mouth stretching across their faces and slightly down their necks. Gastrulans have dark spots patterned across the back and front of their heads, as well as down the backs of their necks. While lacking a visible nose or ears, they do possess eyestalks protruding from the sides of their head, near the joints in their necks.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Gastrulans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 Years | 3-4 Years | 5-9 Years | 10-15 Years | 16-20 Years | 21+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Gastrulans hailed from the musky world of [Gastrula](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gastrula), located within [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories).

**Languages:** The Gastrulan language is very difficult to master by other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). A mixture of borborygmus and gurgles, it is also very slow to speak. Indeed, when Gastrulans do speak, it is always something worth hearing.

**Example Names:** Flasla, Flooas, Gasnny, Trula, Viskas.

**Adventurers:** Gastrulans have little interest in the galaxy, excluding their interest in exotic foodstuffs. Those that do leave [Gastrula](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gastrula) are often found working in cantinas and other culinary jobs to sate their interests. The much rarer Gastrulan adventurers most often ply their talents as [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).

### Gastrulan Species Traits
Gastrulans share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers: **All Gastrulans receive a +2 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Gastrulans are always careful in their decisions, but their slowness to act can frustrate others.
- **Medium** **Size:** As Medium creatures, Gastrulans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Gastrulans have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Extra Arms:** Gastrulans can hold up to four items or Weapons at a time. This ability does not grant extra attacks; however, it does mean a Gastrulan can wield two two-handed weapons at a time.
- **Primitive:** Gastrulans do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Classes) normally grants them.
- **Shell:** Gastrulans are protected by a large Shell, which protects them from many attacks. Attacking a Gastrulan from the side allows them to treat their Shell as [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover), while attacks from the rear allow them to treat their Shell as [Improved Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Improved_Cover). Attacks from the front receive no [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonus.
    - A Gastrulan's Shell has a number of Hit Points equal to 5 x the Gastrulan's Character Level, and has a [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) equal to the Gastrulan's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense).
