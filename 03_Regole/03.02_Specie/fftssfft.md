*Fftssfft Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The Fftssfft inhabit the leading edge of the [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) grasslands, where the meadow runs up against the border of the Great Forest. Their frightful presence is the reason why few [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) and other members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) have ever crossed the grasslands and reached the land of the [Gupins](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gupins), appellating them as "Dandelion Warriors."

One out of every one hundred quills is envenomed, and once this poison quill has embedded itself in its target its trailing end splits to form a distinctive starburst shape. Though deadly, these "star urchin" quills have applications in [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ewok.md|Ewok]] medicine. The Fftssfft's reason for killing appears to be purely territorial- the creatures draw all the sustenance they need directly from the soil. 

### Fftssfft Characteristics
**Personality:** The Fftssfft are extremely territorial creatures, and defend their growing land with ferocity. However, while they only attack other beings when their territory was threatened, their fierce presence results in few members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) ever cross the territories of these "dandelion warriors."

**Physical Description:** Fftssfft resemble thick-stalked, yellow-tufted plants just over a meter in height. When they detect movement their eyes flash open, their arms extend from their body-stems, and their tufts bristle to form a thicket of menacing spines. An angry Fftssfft will hurl its quills in a targeted spray toward its victim, who usually collapses to the ground, skewered like a pincushion. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Fftssfft age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 Years | 3-5 Years | 6-15 Years | 16-21 Years | 22-26 Years | 25+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Fftssfft grow in the meadows of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), most notably in the area east of the moon's Great Forest.

**Languages:** Not really an articulated language, Fftssfft is spoken with hissing sounds by forcing air through tiny pores in their vegetal bodies

**Example Names:** Cclhhlcc, Jjnssjjn, Kkdppkkd, Wwqbbqww.

**Adventurers:** Although the Fftssfft are only semi-sentient, some had found their way offworld; notably some "dandelion warriors" take part in the Big Game, a daily gladiator fight on [The Wheel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wheel). There and in other arenas, the Fftssfft are counted amongst the best warriors in the galaxy.

- **Cooperative:** A Fftssfft automatically succeeds when attempting to [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) on a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check), as long as the target is adjacent to, and can hear and understand, the Fftssfft.
- **Photosynthesis:** As plants, Fftssfft have no need for food. They have a greatly reduced need for water as long as they have regular access to broad-spectrum light. A Fftssfft needs only one-tenth the water of most [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), but if deprived of sunlight, it [Starves](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starves), much as other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) do when lacking food.
    - A Fftssfft that enters a [Force Trance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Trance) can survive almost indefinitely in an area with natural sunlight and rain.

- **Sharp Quills:** A number of times in an encounter equal to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier (minimum 1), a Fftssfft can pull one of their sharp, hairlike quills as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). These Sharp Quills are treated as [Simple Weapons (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapons_(Melee)), dealing 1d6 points of Piercing damage, and can be [Thrown](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Fftssfft can speak Fftssfft. They have no written form of their language.
