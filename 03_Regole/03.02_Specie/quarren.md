The Quarren hail from the distant Outer Rim planet of [Mon Calamari](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mon_Calamari_(Planet)), sharing the world with the sentient humanoid [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) of the same name. The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/mon-calamari.md|Mon Calamari]] live on the surface of the world, while the more isolationist Quarren dwell in oxygen-filled cities in the deep recesses of the oceans.

Offworld, Quarren generally stay clear of galactic politics. Instead, they often become involved with shadowy occupations such as pirates, smugglers, and spy networks. Many Quarren blame both the Empire and the Rebels (even more than the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/mon-calamari.md|Mon Calamari]]) for their homeworld's devastation during the Galactic Civil War.

### Quarren Characteristics
**Personality:** Practical and conservative, Quarren tend to hate change and distrust anyone who displays overt optimism and idealism.

**Physical Description:** The average Quarren stands 1.8 meters tall. They have leathery skin and heads that resemble four-tentacled squids, hence the name "Squid Head" sometimes used by others.

**Adventurers:** Quarren leave their homeworld to escape their dependency on the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/mon-calamari.md|Mon Calamari]].
