*Mimph Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Despite their small stature in comparison to many other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), Mimphs are fierce hunters, frequently banding together in parties to capture larger prey on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor). Their primitive societies don't inhibit their ability to outwit other members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), with a rare few even allowed limited trade, and they have mastered the art of hunting by using lengths of rope and large, elaborate traps to overcome their smaller sizes. Fascinated by larger creatures, Mimphs often put especially notable creatures on display for their village's entertainment.

### Mimph Characteristics
**Personality:** Fierce warriors with sharp minds and a penchant for clever tricks, Mimphs work well in group tactics and form strong communal ties.

**Physical Description:** Mimphs are tiny creatures covered in pink fur, with lighter shades covering the lower half of their faces and the inside of its ears. Two whiskers protrude from the sides of their small, red noses. While their limbs were quite thin compared to their bodies, their heads are disproportionately large.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Mimphs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-14 Years | 15-29 Years | 30-39 Years | 40-44 Years | 45+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Mimphs live in defensible villages scattered across [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), each carefully constructed to fend off larger predators.

**Languages:** Mimphish is a squeaking set of noises that a speaker can use to rapidly call out to its fellows.

**Example Names:** Basher, Crasher, Masher, Smasher, Thrasher.

**Adventurers:** Mimphs are most at home as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), leveraging their talents in stealth and ambush. A handful might instead act as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), prioritizing their raw power or subtle trickery respectively. Few Mimphs choose to be [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) or [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) without outside encouragement.
