*Kyuzo Species data created by TheSagaContinues user Serfious.*

Kyuzo are a sentient humanoid [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) native to the gravity-heavy Outer Rim world of [Phatrong](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Phatrong), where they evolved dense muscle fibers and fast reflexes. A Species known for its strong sense of honor and proud martial history, the Kyuzo's Clovocs, a subculture of fighting orders that maintained law and order in specific regions of their homeworld, were one the most recognized elements of the Species' culture in the galaxy at large.

Kyuzo warriors traditionally wore wide-brimmed war helmets that also served as shields or as thrown missiles, which were originally designed as a headpiece by the inhabitants of the Kwaidan Peaks to protect travelers from torrential rains during monsoon season in southern Phatrong.
### Kyuzo Characteristics
**Personality:** A Species known for their strong sense of justice and honor, most Kyuzo regard oaths and contracts as unbreakable; and many [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) seek them as mercenaries, law-enforcement personnel and bounty hunters. A highly political Species, the Kyuzo developed societies that spanned considerable geographical areas, and most identify as members of a particular country or region. Most major islands and continents were their own political units, though they do form a loose confederacy.

**Physical Description: **Kyuzo have green skin ranging from lighter olive shades, to deep blue-green colors, and wrinkled faces that sported a pair of piercing, yellowish eyes. There are two primary phenotype within the Kyuzo population: some have compound eyes, while others have eyes with black, slit-shaped pupils akin to those of [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Kyuzo age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-17 Years | 18-49 Years | 50-84 Years | 85-94 Years | 95+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) planet of [Phatrong](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Phatrong), home to heavy gravity and mountainous climates.

**Languages:** Kyuzo favor their own language, Kyuzo, which consists of quickly spoken short words and phrases. Although Kyuzo could learn to understand Basic without difficulty, and most picked up the skill at a young age, they find it difficult to speak and grammatically confusing.

**Example Names:** Drego, Embo, Grimshaw, Khalu, Noru, Nyessa, Streehn, Zuvio.

**Adventurers: **The Kyuzo are not a prominent Species in the galaxy at large, though some travel extensively for business, trade, and exploration, often in the service of a Clovoc, or to escape other. Most Kyuzo that leave Phatrong become [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), with the rest either becoming [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), or in the case of merchants and businessmen, [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles).
