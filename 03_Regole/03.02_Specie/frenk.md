*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Bounty Hunters & Mercenaries (Part 1)*

The Frenk Military is remarkably impressive for a defense force; most Frenk need to serve at some point. This universal service allows Frenk to fit into galactic society as mercenaries and bounty hunters, unable to escape their life of violence. While the Frenk remain neutral during the Clone Wars, several independent Frenk operate with both sides of the war.
