*Mandallian Species data created by Wikia user TysFTW.*

The Mandallian Giants are a race of physically large and muscular reptilian beings covered in green scales. Their homeworld [Mandallia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mandallia) is the neighbor world of the Mandalorian's home planet, [Mandalore](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalore). The two worlds became associated after a failed invasion by the ancient Mandalorian Crusaders displayed the prowess of Mandallia's inhabitants, earning the Mandallians their respect.

[Mandallia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mandallia) became a part of Mandalorian Space following The Mandalorians' conquest of expansion during the early years of the Republic, with many Mandallians having earned the right to join [The Mandalorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians) and fight alongside the original [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/taung.md|Taung]].

### Mandallian Characteristics
**Personality:** Mandallians are trained from birth to be in the combat arts that made them formidable warriors. Many wander the stars as gladiators or soldiers of fortune.

**Physical Description:** Mandallians are physically large and heavily muscular reptilian beings covered in green scales. Their heads are dominated by large, pointed fin-like ears, with their face being protected by a long tusk-like bony plate. Their mouths are filled with serrated teeth as well as a pair of needle-sharp fangs, which hang from their upper jaw.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Mandallians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

| 1-16 Years | 17-20 Years | 21-60 Years | 61-80 Years | 81-100 Years | 101+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Mandallia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mandallia) is located within the Mandalore System, occupying the sixth orbit around the system's star between the orbits of [Mandalore](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalore) and [Bonagal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonagal).

**Language:** Mandallians communicate primarily through Mandallian, though their proximity to Mandalore has made many fluent in Mando'a. Mandallians that leave Mandalorian Space soon find themselves learning Basic in short order.
