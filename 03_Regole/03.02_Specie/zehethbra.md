*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Species Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Species_Sourcebook)*

The Zehethbra are technologically advanced spacefarers who have settled many worlds across the galaxy, giving rise to colonies with distinctive cultural and ethnic traits. They have a reputation as moody and dangerous beings who attack with little provocation. Despite (or perhaps because of) their ferocious reputation, Zehethbra are sought out as bodyguards and soldiers by legitimate governments and criminal organizations alike. 

Zehethbra have hair-trigger tempers, and spats between competing individuals can be fierce. While fatalities are rare, more than a few young Zehethbra have perished by allowing their tempers get the better of them when facing down an elder. They have a strong sense of social status and will defer to individuals that prove to be clearly in charge. 

Outraged Zehethbra will release a powerful biochemical spray that stuns and disorients anyone caught in the blast. Members of this Species are immune to the effects of the spray. 
### Zehethbra Characteristics
**Personality:** Zehethbra are moody and temperamental. When angered, a Zehethbra will growl, snarl, and spit at the source of the discomfort, hurling terrible epithets at enemies. Despite their irritable attitude, Zehethbra are fiercely protective of their families and clans. They are territorial and do not like having their personal space violated.

**Physical Description:** Zehethbra are furry, muscular bipeds with fangs. Their fur ranges in color from black to speckled brown. A broad white stripe runs from their noses, up over their heads, and down their backs. Their pawlike hands have claws that add to their fierce appearance but are too small to deal significant damage in combat. A Zehethbra adult stands 1.9 to 2.3 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Zehethbra age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

| 1-9 Years | 10-15 Years | 16-44 Years | 45-64 Years | 65-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Zeheth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zeheth), a temperate planet located in [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim). The Zehethbra live either in urban sprawls or in rural dens built amid the roots of Zeheth's great trees.

**Languages:** The Zehethbra language incorporates snarls, growls, chitters, and angry shrieks. Zehethbra also speak Basic with ease.

**Example Names:** Clyngunn, Fyntarr, Rygulan, Sarnizak.

**Adventurers:** Most Zehethbra adventurers are [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). A few Zehethbra have explored [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) traditions, becoming [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) or, more rarely, [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigies).
