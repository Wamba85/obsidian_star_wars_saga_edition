*Ayrou Species data created by unknown Wikia user (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Ayrou are willowy humanoids from the planet [Maya Kovel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maya_Kovel) in the Moddell Sector. They evolved from a birdlike species yet are incapable of flight.

The Ayrou were one of the first sentient Species in the Moddell Sector to master space flight. They have a baffling cultural paradigma that lets distinguished members of the Species debate a cultural or religious topic for generations, then abruptly commit to a single sociological custom or path. The Ayrou also possess a hoarding instinct that compels them to gather up anything they can find on the off chance that it can be used in the future. The impulse to collect things is easily mistaken for greed, but Ayrou are not usually covetous and regard their gathering nature as simply "Practical."

### Ayrou Characteristics
**Personality:** Ayrou are Strong-willed individualists, wily negotiators, and tireless collectors for information about anything and everything. Despite their relentless drive, the Ayrou are a peaceful Species. They regard haggling and dealing as an art form and think combat is the refuge of juveniles, the feeble-minded, and others who can’t succeed using their wits.

**Physical Description:** A typical Ayrou is tall and thin, standing 2 meters tall but weighing only 65 kilograms. The Ayrou are an attractive Species, with milky white skin and long, lean limbs. Ayrou have flat facial features, with wide-spaced eyes that are typically ruby red, sapphire blue, or emerald green. Instead of hair, Ayrou have a beautiful plumage of feathers in a dazzling array of colors. An Ayrou's plumage reflects his or her health, social status, and attractiveness. Consequently, Ayrou are constantly preening and checking their appearance. Ayrou have four tapered fingers on each hand and are triple-jointed, allowing them to bend their limbs at incredible angles.

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

**Homeworld:** [Maya Kovel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maya_Kovel), a windswept Outer Rim world with a thin, acrid atmosphere.
