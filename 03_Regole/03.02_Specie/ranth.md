The Ranth are predatory hunters who dwell on the frigid dark side of a tidally locked world, where the planet's two large moons provide the only natural illumination. The Ranth have learned to track time by studying the paths of these two satellites.

Sometime in their distant past, the primitive Ranth split into two distinct societies. The first group formed permanent communities atop the planet's great drifting glaciers, slowly advancing toward a sophisticated industrial civilization with a formal government, an interest in galactic affairs, and cavernous ice cities displaying wondrous architecture. The second group remained nomadic and savage by comparison. Roaming in small tribes, these Ranth lack the technology of their more settled counterparts, relying on tireless beasts of burden and their keen predatory instincts to survive. For the most part, the Civilized Ranth and Nomadic Ranth avoid one another, as almost every encounter between the two ends in violence and bloodshed.Both Civilized and Nomadic Ranth maintain strong family ties, as each family carries forward it's own traditions, history, and set of values (Often dictated by the family's elder). Civilized Ranth have extensive contact with the rest of the galaxy, adapting to the latest trends. Nomadic Ranth war fur and leather garments made from the hides of slain beasts, tend to fear offworlders, and work to undermine the Civilized Ranth society.

The Empire occupied the Ranth homeworld for a time. Imperial agents searching for secret Rebel bases encountered the Ranth instead. The Civilized Ranth accepted Imperial rule without a struggle, benefiting from the introduction of new technology and regarding the Empire as a symbol of great achievement and promise. The Nomadic Ranth were far less enamored with the Empire. They attacked Imperial patrols and mining stations before vanishing into the icy wastelands. Unable to track the Nomadic Ranth, the Imperials turned to the Civilized Ranth for assistance. The city-dwellers followed the directive without question, leading to many open conflicts among the Civilized and Nomadic Ranth.

Imperial engineers changed the face of [Caaraz](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Caaraz) with strip-mining, construction, and pollution. With the Empire's defeat, the Civilized Ranth took control of the abandoned Imperial mining installations and processing facilities. Since then, conditions on the planet have deteriorated. Mining facilities have become makeshift cities overpopulated with Ranth that had enjoyed unfettered protection from predators under Imperial rule. The resulting population explosion has left these Ranth impoverished.

The Nomadic Ranth continue to mount attacks against Civilized Ranth communities. Meanwhile, the Civilized Ranth strive to push their primitive brethren deeper into the icy wastelands, where they can pose no threat. Neither society shows any sign of changing its ways.

### Ranth Characteristics
**Personality:** Ranth have short tempers but rarely hold grudges. Civilized Ranth vent their anger in harmless yet flamboyant displays before putting the incident behind them. Nomadic Ranth unleash their anger in wild fits, demonstrations of physical prowess, and momentary acts of violence. Civilized Ranth are more perceptive, introspective, and apathetic then their Nomadic cousins. Nomadic Ranth are resolute, passionate, and calculating.

**Physical Description:** A Ranth has shimmering pale blue fur, sharp claws and fangs, dark eyes, and a bushy tail. A typical Ranth adult stands about 1.65 meters tall.

**Homeworld:** [Caaraz](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Caaraz), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim), is a tide-locked planet that always has one side facing the sun and the other trapped in perpetual night. The sunlight side is blazingly hot and incapable of supporting life.

**Languages:** Ranth speak their own language, which consists of purrs, growls, and throaty vocalizations. Written Ranth uses an alphabet consisting of short, clawlike marks that combine to form distinct characters.

**Adventurers:** Since the Empire's defeat, many Civilized Ranth have left their homeworld and joined the greater galactic community. They usually find work as wilderness guides on other arctic planets as well as mercenaries, bodyguards, and bounty hunters. The few Nomadic Ranth encountered away from [Caaraz](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Caaraz) are slaves relocated by Imperial forces during [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era). Ranth heroes can be of any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class), although [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) are the most common.
