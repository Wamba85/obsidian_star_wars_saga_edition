*Jablogian Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty.*

The proximity of Jablogian homeworld to Hutt Space has garnered them an unfavourable reputation to the civilized galaxy, but many Jablogians have worked perfectly respectable careers. Largely uninterested in others, Jablogians are still capable of forming bonds with others but they rarely venture to the galaxy except for business. Jablogians are prone to salivating everywhere, standing between 1.4-1.7 meters in height, and averaging at least 100 kilograms.
