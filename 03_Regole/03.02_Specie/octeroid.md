Octeroids are an amphibious sentient species native to the aquatic world of [Octero IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Octero_IV). Known galaxy-wide for their striking appearance and simple lifestyle, the Octeroids are thought to be gentle giants with little technology, preferring to stay on their homeworld.

Octeroids are known as poor sabacc players, as their cards are usually visible in the reflection of their eye.
