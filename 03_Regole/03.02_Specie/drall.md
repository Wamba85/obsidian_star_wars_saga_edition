*Drall Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Drall are mild-mannered, short humanoids. As a Species, they are methodical researchers, careful observers, and considered among the best theoretical thinkers in the galaxy. Although well-versed in virtually every widely used technology in the galaxy, and often numbered among scientists who are on the cutting edge in a number of fields. Drall are primarily interested in abstract concepts and accumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Therefore, despite the advanced nature of their scholarly pursuits, the world of [Drall](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Drall_(Planet)) trails behind the rest of the galaxy in technological achievement, and the Drall themselves usually implement technology developed by others. For example, despite their having been part of the galactic community for over twenty millennia, the Drall still rely exclusively on spacefaring technology built by the Corellians.Drall society is a clan-based combination of a matriarch and a meritocracy. No elected or direct hereditary leaders exist on the Drall homeworld. Instead, each family heeds a "Duchess," a female Drall who is deemed the most fit to lead. Once appointed, the Dutchess becomes the owner of all the family's property, and she holds the position for life or until she steps down and passes the title and property along to a suitable heir. Most of the Drall clans follow the overall direction set by the Dutchess of the most prosperous and powerful of all the clans.

Family life is also the most commonly discussed topic among Drall- exchanging gossip about one's family is a perfectly acceptable form of small talk. Drall find it surprising  that other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) may consider probing questions about family affairs an invasion of privacy, although once this is spelled out to them they quickly take steps to avoid offense.

Most Drall who venture from their homeworld work for megacorporations as researchers or medical specialists- one of Drall's main exports, aside from scientific knowledge, is processed medicinal herbs- although a few also make good livings as information brokers.
