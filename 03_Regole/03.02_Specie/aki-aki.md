*Aki-Aki Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

The Aki-Aki are a peaceful Species of desert-dwellers native to [Pasaana](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pasaana). They are perhaps best known for their organisation of the Festival of the Ancestors, a galaxy-renowned celebration occuring once every 42 years.

Most Aki-Aki have rejected the technology of starflight in favour of innovations more practical to their long-term persistence on the planet. Dust farming is one such technology, which allows the Aki-Aki to feed off seeds and spores harvested from the air. Despite lacking experience in the wider galaxy, the Aki-Aki are generally regarded as a hospitable people, even if they do lack some basic amenities for visitors.

While the people of [Pasaana](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pasaana) have experienced war and bloodshed in the past, modern Aki-Aki have largely put their inter-clan differerences aside and live a more prosperous, peaceful existence. However, life for the Pasaanan natives is not without its threats. Pasaana's surface is arid and unforgiving, and dangerous predators are always found around the underground reservoirs which serve as the Aki-Aki's main water source.
