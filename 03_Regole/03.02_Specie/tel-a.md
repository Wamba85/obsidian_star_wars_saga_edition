While the [Mantellian Savrips](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mantellian_Savrips) were the original intelligent inhabitants of [Ord Mantell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Mantell), they were hunted to near-extinction so long ago that most residents of the planet assume the Tel'a to be the native [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). In reality, the Tel'a are [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) descended from [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] Corellian settlers that began farming the countryside 4,000 years before large cities and mining operations ruined the biosphere of [Ord Mantell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Mantell). When the Republic deemed the planet unsuitable for habitation and confined colonists to their cities, the workers in the countryside were subjected to all manner of toxins, diseases, and pollutants, some of which were ill-fated attempts to revitalize the ecosystem. Those who survived developed the ability to metabolize the berries of the Tel'a Briar, a plant which leeches radioactive material from the soil and stores immense amounts of energy. Eventually the Tel'a were able to store this energy in a more permanent form, causing their veins to glow a soft yellow-green that diffuses throughout their skin. When a Tel'a eats one of these berries, the glow becomes even stronger.

The Tel'a people have never had a voice in Ord Mantell City. Mostly confined to their own neighborhood in the Crater District by poverty and discrimination, few of them are able to lead comfortable lives. The only areas with comparable populations of Tel'a are the Outcity farmlands and the slave housing in the Lower Imperial District and Apartment Hell. They are a stateless people who seem to have given up the fight for independence. Despite this, almost all Tel'a possess a powerful connection to their communities and families. Decisions are made by the wisest Elders at the suggestion of community members. Most Tel'a have a strong distrust of hierarchy, and place a high value on equitable decision-making.

Other residents of Ord Mantell City view Tel'a in a few different ways. Some live in harmony with them, even residing in the Crater District's Tel'a Neighborhood. Others are wary of them, or simply ignore them. The strange biology of the Tel'a have lead many to believe that they are contaminated and dangerous, but this is untrue. The energy within a Tel'a is so compartmentalized and non-contaminating that it is nearly impossible for them to reproduce with [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) or other humanoid [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), although this has still been known to happen. Those who see the Tel'a as dangerous or subhuman often refer to them as "Wasters" due to their origin in the radioactive wastelands of old [Ord Mantell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Mantell). Others simply call them "Glow Rods" to make fun of their appearance, a more lighthearted but still harmful insult that has lead to the unofficial nickname of the Tel'a Neighborhood: Glow Rod Ghetto. Tel'a are barred from many jobs, and are not even allowed to enter the Administrative District or Imperial District without a good reason. Even at checkpoints in the less secure districts, guards and Stormtroopers will often find excuses to detain or beat up Tel'a who are traveling where they aren't welcome.
### Tel'a Characteristics
**Personality:** Tel'a can generally be divided into two groups with distinct cultural differences, but very little animosity exists between them. "Hook-Toed" Tel'a live in the Outcity, and are so named because they wear retractable foot anchors to avoid being blown away in the summer windstorms. They tend to be practical, compassionate, and independent. "Flat-Boots" Tel'a live in Ord Mantell City, and most have never been outside its high walls. They might be cynical and downtrodden, or they might be hopeful and loyal to their community. Some Flat-Boots Tel'a are known as "Unwrapped" due to their disregard for the traditional attire that would hide their Species. These people are regarded as very brave, very stupid, or both. Many community leaders are Unwrapped. Tel'a skin glows far stronger when they are in a heightened emotional state, so the Unwrapped are easier to read.

**Physical Description:** The main physical trait that distinguishes Tel'a from [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) and [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) is the soft yellow-green glow of their veins. Tel'a skin tones range from light tan to deep brown, and as a result the specific shade of their glow varies. The white of all Tel'a eyes are tinged with yellow, and most have brown irises. Almost all Tel'a have coarse black hair that turns gray and white with age. Tel'a are slightly shorter than the average [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]], and many have a sturdier build from years of hard labor. Many are embarrassed by their glowing skin or yellowed eyes, while others simply recognize that revealing their Species will cause trouble for them. Because of this, traditional Tel'a clothing includes brown cloth wrappings that cover their skin, especially at night. Many also wear goggles or helmets to cover their eyes. This practice is less common in the Outcity, where Tel'a live in relative peace with other farmers.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Tel'a age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-40 Years | 41-59 Years | 60-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Ord Mantell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Mantell)

**Languages:** The Tel'a native language will contain familiar vocabulary for anyone familiar with old Corellian trade languages and Mando'a. Many Tel'a also learn Bocce, Bith, Aleena, or [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary). Those who deal with [Black Sun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Sun) or their associates may learn Falleen. Tel'a tend to describe things in terms of the natural world, and their voices often sound tired or pained.

**Example Names:** Andrea Za'ir, Gelt Vrona, Io Hakaya, Ira Vex, Miles Brace, Ne'dai Sylvan, Rashida Koe, Shaan Za'ir, Sonya Hakaya, Yasmin Vex.

**Adventurers:** While most Tel'a have had their spirits crushed by the Empire, [Black Sun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Sun), and the corporations of the Republic, some are not ready to give up the fight. These Tel'a often find themselves in the makeshift command center of Ira Vex, taking jobs that further her goals of destabilizing the powers that rule [Ord Mantell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Mantell). Tel'a heroes are usually [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) if they are from Ord Mantell City, or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) if they are from the Outcity. Tel'a [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) are rare community organizers and healers. Tel'a [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are even more rare, since so few receive combat training, but Ira Vex is changing that. No Tel'a has even been inducted into [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order), but they can still be Force-Sensitive. Most Tel'a tended to view [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) with suspicion before they were exterminated, and now think of them as something for the archives of history.
### Tel'a Species Traits
Tel'a share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** None. Tel'a are [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) and while they have common cultural traits, they are more varied in personality and physical capability than other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Tel'a have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Tel'a have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bio-Luminescence:** Tel'a glow in the dark, and due to this they only gain [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) or [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment) from darkness when wearing heavy clothing or armor that covers their skin.
- **Bonus Trained Skill:** Like [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), Tel'a are versatile and adaptable. A Tel'a character chooses one additional [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) at Level 1 from their list of Class Skills.
- **Great Fortitude:** Tel'a gain a +2 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). Tel'a were forced to adapt to a ruined biosphere thousands of years ago, and are stronger for it.
- **Radiation Resistance:** Tel'a receive a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) against [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation). In addition, Tel'a never gain a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) from the effects of [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Tel'a can speak, read, and write both Basic and Tel'a.
