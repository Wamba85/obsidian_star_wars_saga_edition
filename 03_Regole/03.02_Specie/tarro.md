*Tarro Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Tarro are a tall, technologically advanced humanoid Species on the verge of extinction. Nearly a century before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), the Tarro homeworld was destroyed when its sun exploded with little warning. Tarro survivors living in other systems speculated that a Tarro-built superweapon may have caused the catastrophe, although the truth might never be known.

Only a few hundred Tarro survived the destruction of their home system, and they quickly scattered among the stars. A few joined the ranks of [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance); others sought out reported "Lost Colonies" of Tarro in [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions).
### Tarro Characteristics
**Personality:** The Tarro are a stubborn, independent Species. They have little patience for others and are obstinate and abrupt even with others of their own Species. Despite their self-centered attitude, they have a knack for making it clear that if you're not with them, you're in the way. Some Tarro have purportedly learned to overcome their "Loner" attitude.

**Physical Description:** Humanoid, with a large forehead, a thick brow, flat nose, and a broad mouth filled with sharp teeth, the average Tarro stands about 2 meters tllt. A Tarro has seven fingers on each hand that end in sharp claws.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):**Â Tarro age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-16 Years | 17-39 Years | 40-54 Years | 55-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Tililix](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tililix) was a technologically advanced world deep within [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions). Fewer than five hundred Tarro reportedly escaped the destruction of Tli, their sun, setting the Species on the brink of extinction. No new Tarro homeworld has been adopted, as the remaining members of the Species have no desire to get involved what would surely become a bureaucratic process.

**Languages:** Tarrese is a harsh language similar to Basic, with a wide range of vocalizations. Written Tarrese is equally similar to written Basic, with a slightly larger alphabet that accounts for some sounds normally made by combining two or more Basic letters.

**Example Names:** Kassar Kosciusko, Masakayan, Paraster Daskalion, Qatak Qantaras, Terrant Skayanestro, Ruskor Votaran.

**Adventurers:** Tarro usually travel atone. They are most commonly encountered around [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories), where one can stake a claim on a backwater world and need not be concerned with taxation and legal jurisdictions. Tarro encountered in populated regions are usually bounty hunters, mercenaries, or criminal enforcers, and rarely stay there long. They are most commonly [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), or [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers).
