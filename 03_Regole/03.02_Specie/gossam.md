*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*<nowiki> </nowiki>Gossam are diminutive reptilian humanoids known for their shrewd and cunning nature. Few Gossam on their homeworld own property, and instead serve as indentured servants to the Commerce Guild. Most Gossam find this a dreary reality, rarely complaining out loud for fear of losing the roofs over their heads. 

For ten years after the Battle of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo), the Gossam homeworld of [Castell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Castell) suffered a great depression due to the heavy taxation of trade routes. This resulted in lowered profits, and little demand for [Castellan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Castell) goods. Gossam were at each other's throats over food, jobs, and passage offworld until the Commerce Guild finally appointed a Gossam as its president. President Shu Mai is credited with lifting Castell out of it's depression though her aggressive business practices, her support of the Gossam workforce, and her taciturn negotiation tactics.

### Gossam Characteristics
**Personality:** Gossam are selfish, scheming being skilled in the art of business. Their goods are usually cheap to manufacture and overpriced. They are always looking for an angle they can play to come out ahead. A Gossam's word means precious little in most other Species' opinions.

**Physical Description:** A Gossam stands roughly 1.25 meters tall, and has pebbly green skin, large yellow eyes, and an elongated neck, and a tapered head. In addition to exotic robes and finery, Gossam aristocrats and trade negotiators often wear elevated footwear to appear taller during meetings with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Gossam age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-13 Years | 14-44 Years | 45-62 Years | 63-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Castell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Castell) is an industrial world located on the edge of [The Colonies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Colonies), bordering [The Core](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core). The planet is central to the Commerce Guild's manufacturing operations.

**Languages:** Gossam speak a language of the same name. It consists of lispy vocalizations, croaks, and trills. Written Gossam has a jagged alphabet that combines into short words and long sentences. Most Gossam learn Basic.

**Example Names:** Min Cho, Xiri Gan, Zim Li, Shu Mai, Shan Sien, Mei Tran.

**Adventurers:** Most Gossam traveling the galaxy are either legitimate merchants or shady smugglers. Gossam pirates are also common. Due to their small statue, Gossam are frequently underestimated. Most tramp freighter captains pay little heed to reports of Gossam piracy- that is, until they have a Gossam pirate's blaster shoved in their face. Gossam heroes are typically [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel). Force-users among the [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) are exceedingly rare.
