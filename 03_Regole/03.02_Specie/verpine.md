*Reference Book: [Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

The Verpine have been spacefarers for all their recorded history, long before they had contact with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). Verpine have traveled for so long that the name and location of their homeworld have been lost to antiquity. They are fascinated with technology in all its forms, and consider themselves to be experts in all technological fields. Any device that falls into Verpine hands is prone to being taken apart, reassembled, and improved with astounding speed and skill. The asteroid field that the Verpine have transformed into a thriving colony is a testament to their mastery of technology.

Verpine society is guided by an absolute majority rule. Their natural communication ability enables the Verpine of a community to easily poll every individual Verpine within it. Each Verpine has an equal say in any governmental process, and the final decision is binding. This approach to government enables a single Verpine to speak with certainty about his or her community's stance on any given issue.
