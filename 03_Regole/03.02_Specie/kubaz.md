*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

The Kubaz are an intellectual [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) that places great importance on tact and decorum. Kubaz value art, music, and other forms of sophisticated entertainment, and they place great emphasis on traditions and the safekeeping of family. Off their homeworld, their love of decorum is often frustrated by the fact that they feed almost exclusively on insects. They do not recognize insectoid beings- including sentient insectoids- as anything but food sources.

Kubaz are rarely encountered away from their homeworld, since they have not developed interstellar travel and must rely on other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to transport them. The Republic discouraged the Kubaz from developing hyperspace technology until they learned to recognize the rights of sentient insectoids. The Empire maintained this policy, but the Kubaz grew increasingly eager to extend their knowledge of the galaxy during the Rebellion era and committed greater resources toward developing or acquiring hyperspace technology. Meanwhile, the Empire used it's vast intelligence resources to thwart the Kubaz society's development efforts as part of its strategy to isolate alien [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) from [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans). Through propaganda, the Empire convinced the Kubaz that the Rebels were sabotaging their scientific efforts, leading many Kubaz to regard the Empire as their friend and ally.

Like their mistreatment of insectoid beings, the Kubaz do not view such pursuits as unlawful or immoral.
