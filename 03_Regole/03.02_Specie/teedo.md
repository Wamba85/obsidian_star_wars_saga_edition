*Teedo Species data created by Wikia user Darthauthor.*Teedos are small reptilian beings that prowl the wastes of [Jakku](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jakku), their features hidden behind mummy-like wrappings. Often found riding cybernetic pack animals called [Luggabeasts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Luggabeasts), they know many of Jakku's secrets. Teedos make no distinction between individuals and the Species as a whole, and are rumored to share knowledge in some unknown and perhaps unconscious fashion. Jakku's scavengers treat them with respectful caution, wary of their unpredictable natures.
### Teedo Characteristics
**Personality:** Fiercely territorial, Teedos live as scavengers, prowling the wastes of [Jakku](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jakku). They are secretive and suspicious of outsiders, often fighting with other scavengers over machinery that could be salvaged for sale. As scavengers, Teedos are capable mechanics and tinkerers, and were gifted in finding useful pieces. Their unpredictable nature had them treated with respectful caution on [Jakku](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jakku).

**Physical Description:** Teedos are sentient reptilians with scaly gray-green skin. Averaging 28 kilograms in weight and 1.24 meters in height, Teedos cover themselves with systems of filters and tubes which reclaimed most of their bodies' water for recycling. Although much of their bodies are covered in wrappings and a mask, they possess hands and feet each with three digits.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Teedos age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-14 Years | 15-29 Years | 30-44 Years | 45-59 Years | 60+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Teedos hail from [Jakku](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jakku), although some scholars believe that they arrived on the world through migration. Teedos are common sights on the world, and frequently sell their salvage to offworlds traveling out from the galactic Core.

**Languages:** Teedos speak through Teedospeak, a sharp language with rigid hieroglyphics. During the late Rise of the Empire Era, Teedospeak rose in prominence as a trading language within the Western Reaches of [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim).

**Example Names:** None. Teedoes make no distinction between individuals, each identifying themselves simply as Teedo.

**Adventurers:** Teedoes rarely leave [Jakku](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jakku), content to their salvaging operations. Some might find work offworld as [Scoundrel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), although Teedo [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) are most common. If Teedos have had Force-sensitives in their midst, they have been kept well-hidden.
