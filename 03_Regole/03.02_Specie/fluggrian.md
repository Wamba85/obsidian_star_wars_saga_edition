*Fluggrian Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Fluggrians are an amphibious species from [Ploo IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ploo_IV). Their emnity with the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/glymphid.md|Glymphids]] of [Ploo II](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ploo_II) stretches back many generations.

Crime is endemic on Ploo IV, and successive opportunistic governments have sought to blame the planet's problems on the neighbouring Glymphids to deflect attention from their own corruption. Wealthy crime lords are well connected with Fluggrian local governments, and in many cases run them directly.
### Fluggrian Characteristics
**Personality:** Plagued by a high crime rate, the Fluggrians of [Ploo IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ploo_IV) are highly suspicious as a society, as well as highly intolerant of the neighbouring Glymphids. While in most cases their mental acuity is rather low, they do possess a high aptitude for manual mechanical work such as fixing and modifying personal vehicles. 

**Physical Description:** Fluggrians are a squat species with high foreheads which jut forward over their face. They have spindly limbs, with large talons on their three-fingered hands. Their green skin is dotted with several sensory inputs in the form of purple spikes, which are capable of processing information at a high rate of speed. Large, square teeth fill their mouths and are hidden behind thick lips. They breathe through gill-like neck bands and average around a metre (just over 3 feet) in height.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Fluggrians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 Years | 6-11 Years | 12-42 Years | 42-79 Years | 80-89 Years | 90+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Fluggrians live in floating cities connected by thick underwater tubes on the planet [Ploo IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ploo_IV).

**Language:** Fluggrians generally favour the Huttese language over Basic.

**Example Names:** Borzu Nale, Cuhoon, Elan Mak, Kam Nale

**Adventurers:** While they can be of any class, Fluggrians are typically [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels).
### Fluggrian Species Traits
Fluggrians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Fluggrians receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Fluggrians have quick reaction speeds, but aren't particularly witty or astute.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Fluggrians gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Fluggrians have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Breathe Underwater:** As amphibious creatures, Fluggrians can't drown in water.
- **Mechanical Aptitude:** Fluggrians have a knack for technology. Once per encounter, a Fluggrian can treat any single [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check as if the die roll is a Natural 20.
- **Quick Reflexes:** A Fluggrian's purple sensor spikes allow them to respond to threats at lightning speeds. A Fluggrian may choose to reroll any [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Fluggrians can speak, read, and write Huttese.
