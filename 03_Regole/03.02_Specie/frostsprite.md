*Frostsprite Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Enthralling tradesmen with ambitions higher than their mountainous homes, Frostsprites hold domain over the more frigid regions of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). Nominally allied with the [Iceheads](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iceheads) for physical protection, Frostsprites leverage their intellects on schemes to advance themselves as far as possible. Whether it be social, business, or even territory, the first thought of every Frostsprite is "How can I get more?" This has, of course, put them in direct competition against [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), but their aspirations can still see them through such complication.

### Frostsprite Characteristics
**Personality:** Always ready with honeyed words, Frostsprites hold lofty aspirations that care little for their neighbors. While these ambitions are not necessarily bad, it is the Frostsprites methods that often earns them the ire of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes).

**Physical Description:** Frostsprites are teal-skinned humanoids with yellow eyes and a spined frill that frames their regal faces. Their eye-catching appearances serve them well in catching their targets off-guard whether in combat or negotiations.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Frostsprites age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-20 Years | 21-59 Years | 60-79 Years | 80-99 Years | 100+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Frostsprites live in the few snowy mountain ranges of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), living in small family groups before setting out on their own in adulthood.

**Languages:** Rimese is a shared language amongst Frostsprites, [Iceheads](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iceheads), and [Ice Demons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Demons). It carries sharp tones that cut through the high winds of their homes.

**Example Names:** Ecju, Ipma, Odra, Ukto.

**Adventurers:** The schemes of a Frostsprite are best done as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), and those more willing to get their hands dirty might also act as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). Frostsprite [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are far less common, as they usually few such roles as beneath them.
### Frostsprite Species Traits
Frostsprites share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Frostsprites receive a +2 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Despite their grand ambitions, Frostsprites struggle to form real connections with others.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Frostsprites have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Frostsprites have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Cold Resistance:** Frostsprites gain a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) to resist [Extreme Cold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold).
- **Primitive:** Frostsprites do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Soothing Voice:** A Frostsprite may choose to reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Startle:** Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to being attacked, a Frostsprite can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check against the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If successful, the attacker takes a -5 penalty on their attack roll.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Frostsprites can speak Rimese. They have no written form of their language.
