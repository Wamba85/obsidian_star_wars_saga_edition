Tusken Raiders, or Sand People, are primitive desert-dwelling warriors, skilled at defending their harsh way of life and surviving in an even harsher environment. These brutal nomads were the dominant sentient Species on [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine) until offworlders colonized the planet during the time of the Old Republic. [Jawas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jawas), the planet's only other indigenous Species, were more intelligent than the Tusken Raiders, but lacked the ferocity and size to compete with their predatory neighbors. Whereas the [Jawas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jawas) learned to coexist with the early offworld colonists, the Tusken Raiders attacked offworlders on sight.

Tusken Raiders earned their name by destroying and plundering a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] colony at Fort Tusken. The massacre ultimately failed to force settlers to leave [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine), and the Sand People have yet to repeat such a stunning attack, but it is remembered as an example of their bloodthirstiness. The settlers' hatred and fear of these ruthless nomads led to the decimation of the Tusken Raider population in subsequent years. Entire tribes were wiped out, and the survivors were driven into the Deep Deserts.

The average Tusken Raider fears machines. The whine of a Speeder or Swoop usually foretells the approach of murderous offworlders, and even the bravest Tusken Raider must think twice before facing such foes. Tusken Raiders prefer to attack in large numbers, and even then, their targets are usually no more threatening than a moisture farm or ill-defended [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/jawa.md|Jawa]] Sandcrawler.

Although technologically primitive by galactic standards, Tusken Raiders make good use of whatever technological items they can salvage from slain offworlders or [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/jawa.md|Jawa]].

Tusken Raiders use [Banthas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Banthas), large herd animals native to Tatooine, as mounts during scouting missions and hunting expeditions. Some Tusken villages also use domesticated [Massiffs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Massiffs) as watchdogs. Tusken Hunters typically arm themselves with [Gaffi Sticks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gaffi_Sticks) and [Slugthrower Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Slugthrower_Rifles).
