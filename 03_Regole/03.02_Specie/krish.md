*Krish Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*Krish love games. Their economy and culture are based on gaming, and gambling, and rigorous sports. The higher the stakes, the more intriguing the game. Krish unabashedly scour the galaxy in search of danger, excitement, and new distractions. They like to incite conflict, take risks, and gamble with the lives of other. Such pursuits have led many Krish to become pirates, gamblers, mercenaries, and bounty hunters.
The Krish evolved from mammalian jungle predators. Although they enjoy being part of the galactic community, the Species has contributed precious little to its advancement. The Krish allow their preoccupation with various cultural pastimes to interfere with their work, and they allow self-interest to rule their lives. Krish officials are often corrupt, treating politics as any other game and a means to gain personal prestige and power.

Krish look for ways to focus their natural aggression. They love to play games and solve convoluted puzzles, and they watch just about every sport in the galaxy. Highly competitive, they prefer a challenge to "An Easy Kill" (A common Krish metaphor for any sort of mismatch). For instance, a Krish bounty hunter will give weak quarry every conceivable advantage to keep the hunt challenging.

### Krish Characteristics
**Personality:** Krish are cunning, fearless, unscrupulous, and easily goaded. They smile in the face of adversity and look down on weaker beings with dull amusement. Altruists, they are not.

**Physical Description:** Krish have muscular bodies, flat noses, stringy black hair, and wide mouths filled with rows of small, pointy teeth. Krish grin widely even when only mildly amused. The average Krish stands about 1.75 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Krish age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Homeworld:** [Sanza](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sanza), a temperate Mid Rim world. Any habitable land that is not needed to grow food, manufacture necessary goods, or otherwise support the indigenous population plays host to arenas, race tracks, casinos, and other entertainment-driven enterprises.

**Languages:** The Krish language consists of grunts, bellows, and gruff vocalizations. Written Krish is a puzzling hodge-podge of alphabets combined into words with as few syllables as possible.

**Example Names:** Endelor Darvat, Gamgalon, Ligg Panat, Tyro Viveca.

**Adventurers:** Krish adore new challenges, and their short attention spans make them notoriously unreliable as cohorts and business partners. Krish heroes usually begin as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).
