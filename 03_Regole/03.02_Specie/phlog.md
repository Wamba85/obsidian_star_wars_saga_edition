*Phlog Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

A race of giants, Phlogs are believed to have arrived on the Forest Moon aboard an off-course slave caravel that vanished from sector logs. Some biologists believe that Endor's [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gorax.md|Gorax]] population came from the same ship, and that the two giant Species may share an ancestral homeworld. So far no one has gotten close enough to the behemoths to collect a genetic sample. 

Like the [Goraxes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Goraxes), the Phlogs have gravitated toward the driest and harshest areas of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). Phlogs are hunter-gatherers who subsist on desert fungus, as well as fruits and bark found on the outskirts of the forest. They wear tattered clothing and speak in their monosyllabic native tongue of Phlog, though a few have learned to speak a halting, pidgin form of Ewokese. Phlogs form closely-bonded family units and rarely travel far from their desert caves in Simoom. Members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) may go years without ever laying eyes on a Phlog, which is just the way most of them like it. 

Phlogs also hate [Goraxes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Goraxes), and the two Species sometimes come to blows in vicious territorial disputes. A Phlog and a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gorax.md|Gorax]] clashing in a full-scale brawl is a terrifying sight.
### Phlog Characteristics
**Personality:** Phlogs are even-tempered, but an angry Phlog can destroy almost anything in its path. For this reason Phlogs have been courted by the [Duloks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Duloks) and other hostile parties as muscle-for-hire. Since Phlogs are not the brightest creatures on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), they can easily be tricked into believing that another party has done them wrong. The [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) still tell tales of Feather Green Village, reduced to splinters in less than an hour when a Phlog assumed the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) had stolen his lucky hanadak skull. 

**Physical Description:** Male Phlogs can grow as tall as 20 meters, with females averaging 17 meters or less. They have tough, orangish skin and pointed nails for shredding bark from trees. The males have lumpy humanlike features with bulbous noses, while the females have flat, wide nostrils and horns on their heads that first appear in adolescence.  

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Phlogs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-17 Years | 18-40 Years | 41-100 Years | 101-149 Years | 150-179 Years | 180+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor); Almost all Phlogs inhabit the Desert of Simoom, a wasteland of powdery stone and armored lichen located south of the Great Forest, far from the Desert of Salma which is ruled by the [Goraxes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Goraxes).

**Languages:** Phlogs speak their monosyllabic language, with a select few learning Ewokese or Dulok.

**Example Names:** Dobah, Hoom, Hoona, Hue, Nahkee, Zut.

**Adventurers:** Phlogs are occasionally hired by [Duloks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Duloks) and [Skandits](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skandits) for extra muscle, but the majority are content to live in their solitary communities. [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are the most common role these beings take, with the occasional [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) or [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) Phlog that possess a greater cunning than their fellows.
### Phlog Species Traits
Phlogs share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Phlogs receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Phlogs are strong and agreeable, but are extremely gullible and quick to jump to conclusions.
- **Huge Size:** As Huge creatures, Phlogs take a -2 size penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a -10 size penalty on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks, and they gain a +10 size bonus to their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). Their lifting and carrying limits are quadruple those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Phlogs have a base speed of 8 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Phlog with [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Survival)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Survival)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Intimidating Presence:** Phlogs may choose to reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) others, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Primitive:** Phlogs do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Phlogs can speak Phlog. They have no written form of their language.
