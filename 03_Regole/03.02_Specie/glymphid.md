*Glymphid Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

The Glymphids are a small, thin species of long-snouted aliens. They originate from [Ploo II](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ploo_II), where they have long been at war with their neighbours, the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/fluggrian.md|Fluggrians]] of [Ploo IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ploo_IV). The two species share a deep mutual hatred.
### Glymphid Characteristics
**Personality:** Glymphids are typically thought of as being cruel, sadistic killers, though this stereotype is partially due to the fame of the podracer and assassin [Aldar Beedo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aldar_Beedo). 

**Physical Description:** Glymphids are rod-thin with tan and blue skin, incandescent orange eyes, long snouts, frills on their necks, rounded nodules on their torsos, and suction cups on their fingers.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Glymphids age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-14 Years | 15-45 Years | 46-79 Years | 80-99 Years | 100+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Glymphids are native to [Ploo II](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ploo_II), a planet with a sizeable minority population of [Quermians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quermians).

**Language:** Glymphids usually prefer to speak Huttese over Basic. They often also pick up Quermian.

**Example Names:** Aldar Beedo, Keedee Dudar, Patoh Tarbore, Zeebu Nalbo

**Adventurers:** Glymphids make good [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), though they can be of any class.
### Glymphid Species Traits
Glymphids share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Glymphids receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Glymphids have quick reaction speeds, but their bodies are long and thin in comparison to their size.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Glymphids gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Glymphids have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Bonus Feat:** Long periods of war and unrest in Glymphid society have given rise to many cruel-hearted and cold assassins and mercenaries. All Glymphids gain [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/sadistic-strike.md|Sadistic Strike]] as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Darkvision:** Glymphids ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (including [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness. However, they cannot perceive colors in total darkness.
- **Scent:** Glymphids have a keen sense of smell. At close range (within 10 squares), Glymphids ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) and [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) for purposes of [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks, and take no penalty from poor visibility while [Tracking](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tracking).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Glymphids can speak, read, and write both Huttese and Quermian.
