*Nuknog Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Nuknog are diminutive humanoids with small brains and short tempers. Nearly 1,000 years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), Nuknog leaders "sold" their homeworld to a consortium of unscrupulous mining corporations in exchange for jobs, food, and modest accommodations.

The Nuknog worked in mines and processing factories, performing tasks deemed too dangerous for offworld personnel. They received no money for their work, ate leftovers, and slept in tight, prefabricated military barracks. Shoddy equipment and mining accidents claimed countless Nuknog lives, and all that time the Nuknog had no sense that the corporations were exploiting and mistreating them.

The Nuknog remained the unknowing slaves of one corporation or another for centuries as mining contracts changed hands. It wasn't until a pair of Jedi came to the planet in search of a wanted criminal that the mistreatment of the Nuknog caught the attention of the greater galactic community. The Republic Senate ordered the mining corporations to terminate all operations on the Nuknog homeworld and repay several centuries' worth of lost wages. The corporations dissolved amid the controversy, leaving the Nuknog with empty mines, empty factories, and empty stomachs. Sympathy for the Nuknog ran high. Republic relief workers delivered emergency food supplies to the starving Nuknog and offered to help rebuild the planet's devastated agricultural industry. Thinking that the Republic, like the mining corporations might be manipulating them in some fashion, the Nuknog took the free food but blamed the Republic for depriving them of the only life they knew. Their leaders demanded that the Republic provide the Nuknog with food and supplies in perpetuity. When it became clear that the Nuknog were unwilling to help themselves, all sympathy for the Species evaporated.

With the rise of the Separatists and the events leading up to the Clone Wars, the Republic faced political turmoil on many fronts. The plight of the Nuknog no longer captured the interest of the Senate or the galaxy at large. The Nuknog now had another reason to resent the Republic.

The Nuknog change very little after the Clone Wars and the fall of the Republic. The average life expectancy of a Nuknog is nearly doubled if it makes its home offworld- a luxury few Nuknog can afford. That said, a few Nuknog have successfully bought passage on passing ships, usually by selling themselves into slavery
### Nuknog Characteristics
**Personality:** Nuknog are short-tempered, petty, easily manipulated beings who rarely see the big picture. They resent most other beings in the galaxy and blame the most convenient scapegoats for their problems. The bravest Nuknog actually have the will and drive to rise above their meager lives, and they are rare indeed.

**Physical Description:** A Nuknog is a bipedal, reptilian humanoid with a long, skinny neck, bulbous snout, stocky legs, and a bumpy ridge along the centerline of the skull. The average Nuknog stands approximately 1.2 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Nuknog age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-16 Years | 17-35 Years | 36-49 Years | 50-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Sump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sump) is a humid, dilapidated Outer Rim world few care to visit. Pollution from offworld mining interests has contaminated the ecosystem, creating vast, toxic marshes incapable of sustaining life. Somehow, the Nuknog manage to survive, though barely.

**Languages:** Nuknog speak a language of the same name. lt consists of squeaks, barks, and gruff vocalizations. Written Nuknog uses a simple alphabet.

**Example Names:** Ark Roose, Buhar Lod, Noop Warko, Po Nulnik, Skoo Runkin, Vek Bolko.

**Adventurers:** Most Nuknog jump at the chance to leave [Sump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sump) and never return. They are easily manipulated with promises of safe passage offworld, but they have few skills to offer. Some Nuknog will volunteer to become slaves just to get away from their homeworld, although not all Nuknog are willing to take such extreme measures, given how most slaves are treated. Nuknog heroes are usually [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels).
