The Myneyrshi are four-armed natives of [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland). Before the Empire conquered their world and turned it into a secret storehouse for the Emperor, the Myneyrshi were constantly at war with another of Wayland's sentient Species, the [Psadans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Psadans). The Myneyrshi and [Psadans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Psadans) joined forces to drive the Imperials from their world, but they failed. The Empire conquered the planet, enslaved its indigenous population, and put the Myneyrshi and thelr allies to work building an immense complex beneath Mount Tantiss. The Imperial occupation of [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland) ended soon after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

Most Myneyrshi view technology as an unwelcome reminder of their Imperial conquerors and prefer the use of simple weapons and tools. Although peace treaties with other indigenous [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) of [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland) persist for years after the Empire's departure, Myneyrshi remain wary of their alien neighbors.

The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] conquer [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland) during [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era), and although thousands flee and escape with their lives, the primitive Myneyrshi refuse to leave and are either exterminated or driven deep into the jungles. With so few tribes remaining, the future of the Species is uncertain.

### Myneyrsh Characteristics
**Personality:** Myneyrshi are obstinate beings, especially when dealing with [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) and other offworlders. Their experience with the Imperial occupation of [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland) and their enslavement has soured them toward [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) and technology. Myneyrshi consider anything technological in nature an "Item of Shame" and avoid even being near it when possible.

**Physical Description:** Thin of build, Myneyrshi have two upper torsos (One atop the other), four arms, long pointy ears, and a short trunk instead of a nose. Their entire bodies are covered in a smooth layer of blue crystalline flesh. The average Myneyrsh stands 1.9 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Myneyrshi age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-17 Years | 18-49 Years | 50-69 Years | 70-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland), a remote and unremarkable jungle world in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** Myneyrshi speak a primitive language of snorts, honks, and deep vocalizations called Myneyrsh. No written form of their language exists. Myneyrshi pass on knowledge through an oral history

**Example Names:** Chyresh, Eychani, Orychee, Panaysha.

**Adventurers:** Myneyrshi have expressed no desire to leave their homeworld, Their isolation, their dislike for technology, and their unpleasant encounters with the Empire and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] discourage them from roaming the galaxy. Although the odds are remote, a Myneyrsh forcibly dispatched from [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland) might find a life of adventure among the stars and learn to overcome their natural distrust of technology and more technologically advanced [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). A Myneyrsh hero would most likely become a [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) or [Force Prodigy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigy).
