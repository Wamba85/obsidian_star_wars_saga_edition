*Em'liy Species data created by Wikia user Jdborghetti (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Imperial forces drove the Em'liy, the dominant Species of [Shalyvane](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shalyvane), from their cities. A disgraced people with no home and no resources to rebuild cities, the Em'liy felt undeserving of a name and simply called themselves "Nomads." Maligned and homeless for years, the Em'liy evolved into a hardy and tenacious people who have only recently begun to rebuild their capital city and explore the galaxy.

Angered Em'liy are dangerous foes and loyal friends. They are not easily impressed; those who impress them have allies for life. Entire wars have ended because one Em'liy general sufficiently impressed another in the course of battle. Since their fail from grace, however, much of their arrogance has left them, replaced with feeling of loss and restlessness. The Em'liy are deadly warriors, with a ferocity in battle unmatched by many warrior [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). Observes have labeled this ferocity "Berserker" behavior, though this is not entirely accurate. Warring Em'liy give themselves over completely to a fight, letting the course of battle define their actions and thoughts. They control their own actions, but the Spirit of Battle helps refine that control.

### Em'liy Characteristics
**Personality:** Em'liy are born survivors, raised to hunt for every morsel of food and fight for every drop of water. They take nothing for granted and tend to possess a fatalistic approach toward life. They expect no favors and express only contempt for the lazy, spoiled, or domineering.

**Physical Description:** The Em'liy have muscular bodies with skin that ranges from yellow-tan to orange to blue. They wear their fine dark hair in long topknots to show caste status and inspire fear in enemies. The number of topknots varies from none to three, depending on caste. Otherwise, their bodies are hairless. Em'liy stand 1,9 meters tall, on average. They have a distinct lack of facial features- their smooth, noseless, and earless faces show little in the way of sensory organs. They have small, round eyes with no lids or lashes, and their thin mouth openings are nearly lipless. A thin, gas-permeable layer of skin covers their auditory and olfactory organs to protect them from the hot sun, harsh wind, and sandstorms of their homeworld. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Em'liy age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-15 Years | 16-35 Years | 36-53 Years | 54-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Shalyvane](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shalyvane), a desert world located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Language:** Em'liy speak and read Em'liy. Most Em'liy also learn to speak Basic.

**Example Names:** Evir'zan, Jelevos, Ji'kata, Karien, Neth, Shanzar, Tez'ra.

**Adventurers:** Em'liy are nomads, and those who manage to leave their homeworld often adopt a nomadic lifestyle in space, traveling from one system to the next aboard tramp freighters and other vessels. Em'liy adventurers can be [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). Em'liy [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) do not exist. Although the Em'liy have no known [Force Traditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Traditions), members of their Species could conceivably learn the ways of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) and either train as [Force Prodigy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigy) or as a [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).
