*H'nemthe Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*H'nemthe are a deeply passionate and spiritual people. Male H'nemthe comprise 95% of the Species' population; whether this is due to a Species-wide genetic defect is unknown. After a H'nemthe couple conceive, the female eviscerates the male with her razor-sharp tongue.

Because their head cones can be used to detect heat differences in other creatures, H'nemthe are efficient hunters.

### H'nemthe Characteristics
**Personality:** H'nemthe males are timid beings who spend most of their adult lives searching for true love. They also believe that death is an important part of life, and that one's own death paves the way for future generations. H'nemthe females lead a sheltered life until they begin to mate, and consequently they tend to be naïve about matters outside the home.

**Physical Description:** A H'nemthe has blue-gray skin, a double set of cheekbones, a gently curved nose, three fingers on each hand, and a head crowned with four short cones. The average adult stands about 1.7 meters tall. The majority of H'nemthe encountered are male.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** H'nemthe age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-6 Years | 7-10 Years | 11-44 Years | 45-59 Years | 60-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [H'nemthe](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/H'nemthe_(Planet)), and [Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim) world with three moons. The moons' collective gravitational force creates unsettled weather conditions across the entire planet. Scientists believe that the H'nemthe evolved their heat-sensing cones to help them forage for food in the inclement weather.

**Languages:** H'nemthe speak a language comprised primarily of squeaks, squeals, and other noises that other sentients find irritating. The written form of H'nemthe uses a wispy, contiguous line to make letters that string together to form words.

**Example Names:** Garriel, H'rassh, Liakkor, S'basso, Vir'roc, Vishki.

**Adventurers:** H'nemthe males seldom seek glory or adventure, but if they are repeatedly rejected as mates, they may roam the galaxy instead of taking their own lives. H'nemthe heroes are typically male and can belong to any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class), although [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) are the most common.
