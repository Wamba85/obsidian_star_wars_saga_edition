Snivvians are short, stocky humanoids whose hardships have produced some of the galaxy's best artists and authors. The Snivvian homeworld has extremely cold temperatures and long winters, forcing the Snivvians to live long periods of time in subterranean caverns. During those long days, Snivvians develop their artistic talents and sensibilities. Although technology would eventually lessen the need for this form of hibernation, Snivvians still feel the need- biologically and culturally- to continue the tradition.

Historically, Snivvians have withstood numerous hardships that they channel into their impressive artistic works. After gaining the ability to travel between the stars, the Snivvians attracted the brutal attention of [The Thalassian Slavers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Thalassian_Slavers). Snivvian culture was nearly destroyed before the Republic discovered the practice and stepped in to protect the Snivvians. This protection has been reduced during eras of warfare, but combined Republic and Snivvian forces remain sufficient to hold off lesser threats.

During [The Old Republic Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era), the Snivvians were still rebuilding the damage done to their society by the slavers and other threats. They proceed with the intent to colonize other worlds. Many Snivvians travel throughout the galaxy, attempting to live the lives of the subjects of their future artistic works, even when it is dangerous. Snivvian enclaves made up of escaped slaves and refugees are scattered throughout the systems near their homeworld.
