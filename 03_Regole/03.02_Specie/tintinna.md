*Homebrew Reference Book: [Alien Anthology Saga Edition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_Anthology_Saga_Edition)*

Tin-Tin Dwarfs are actually known formally as the Tintinna, a Species from the little-known, rarely visited, primitive Outer Rim world of [Rinn](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rinn). They are a rodent-like Species very similar to [Ranats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ranats), and are considered to be distant relatives.

Unlike their cousins, whose incisors emerge from their bottom jaw, the Tintinna have simple, small, rodent incisors that emerge from the tops of their mouths. They have black, mouse-like eyes, small round ears, and soft brown fur. Small pink paws sport nimble digits, and they look, simply, like giant mice. Because of their environment, they often give off a pleasant, wood-chip smell.

Tintinna live in underground burrows that they dig out without the benefit of tools. They line their earthen homes with wood chips, leaves, and other natural materials that serve to keep them warm and dry. They chew the wood for this purpose, as well as to wear down their teeth, which otherwise may grow to uncomfortable lengths.

Because their planet is remote, Tin-Tin Dwarfs are rarely seen off their homeworld. Traders and smugglers use [Rinn](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rinn) as a backwater hiding place, so some Tintinna have been known to befriend spacers and hitch rides offworld. This is an easygoing, pleasant, and curious Species, always looking to learn new things about the universe. Tintinna are quick learners, and when exposed to technology, they begin to understand it almost immediately. Spacers have therefore found them useful as teammates and lookouts, because of their highly sensitive rodent hearing and eyesight.
### Tintinna Characteristics
**Personality:** Tintinna are generally amicable and curious. Although [Rinn](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rinn) has not progressed beyond the steam age of technology, they have little problem in adapting to the wonders of the galaxy. This is an easygoing and pleasant Species, always looking to learn new things about the universe.

**Physical Description:** Tintinna are small, rodent-like beings covered in brown fur. Their ears are small and round, and they have small black eyes. Tintinna had teeth typical of rodent Species, and they need to spend part of their time gnawing in order to keep their teeth from growing too large and cumbersome.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Tintinna age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

**Languages:** Tintinna speak their native language of Rinnese, but are easily capable of learning Basic.

**Example Names:** Kit, Oziaf, Rungs, Squeak.

**Adventurers:** Though few Tintinna have the opportunity to travel off Rinn, some are taken on by visiting spacers as crewmates. In these positions, Tintinna have been able to succeed well as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels).
