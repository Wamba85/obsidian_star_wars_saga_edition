*Ardennian Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Ardennians are a small, four-armed species known for their quick wits and fast reflexes. These traits make them common sights as pilots within the galaxy, both as legitimate freighter captains, or more unsavory as smugglers.

Ardennians are also exceptional business owners, with their larger-than-life personalities making them popular in the service industries among their customers. Their penchant for gossip and rumors can sometimes run afoul of less reputable patrons, but even then an Ardennian is capable of quickly defusing potentially dangerous confrontations.

### Ardennian Characteristics
**Personality:** Ardennians are often quick-witted and good-natured. They are extremely talkative, whether it be about how much they like or hate something, or merely commenting on seemingly frivolous matters. This makes them quite likeable with those they interact with, a boon for those Ardennians in the transport business.

**Physical Description:** Ardennians are small bipeds, with an elongated nose and short blue-gray fur covering most of their bodies. They have narrow dark-colored eyes, and hold a stout posture. An Ardennian's six limbs all share the same structure, with opposable thumbs and four fingers. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ardennians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-16 Years | 17-38 Years | 39-56 Years | 57-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Ardennians hail from their namesake world of [Ardennia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ardennia), an agricultural world with frequent festivals and celebrations.

**Languages:** Ardennians have long since integrated into the galactic community, and primarily communicate through Basic. Although the language of Ardennian is hardly a dead one, it is far from widely spoken.

**Example Names:** Chal, Chio Fain, Rio Durant, Retar, Rone Main.

**Adventurers:** An Ardennian's quick reflexes and piloting skills lends well to the [Scoundrel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel) and [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) Heroic Classes. Their good humored attitudes and talkative personalities also makes Ardennian [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) a fairly common sight. Force-users are far less common, and Ardennian [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are almost nonexistent.
### Ardennian Species Traits
Ardennians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Ardennians receive a +2 bonus to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Ardennians are well known for their agility, but are far more infamous for their inability to stop talking.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Ardennians gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Ardennians have a base speed of 4 squares. They also have a climb speed of 2 squares.
- **Expert Pilot:** With their lightning-quick reflexes, an Ardennian may choose to reroll any [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Extra Arms:** Ardennians can hold up to four items or Weapons at a time. This ability does not grant extra attacks; however, it does mean an Ardennian can wield two two-handed weapons at a time.
- **Automatic Language:** All Ardennians can speak, read, and write Basic.
