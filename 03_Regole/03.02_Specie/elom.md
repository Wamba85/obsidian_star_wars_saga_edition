*Elom Species data created by Wikia user Jdborghetti (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*
The Eloms dwell deep beneath the surface of a world with the same name. Despite their savage and fearsome appearance, they are an easygoing, pacifistic Species of strict herbivores. 

The existence of the Eloms remained unknown even after the Republic made contact with a more technologically advanced Species (The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]]) living on the surface. The Eloms were believed to have died out when the environment of the world turned to permanent drought. The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]] discovered the underground communities of Eloms during a mining accident. Initially, the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]] viewed the Eloms as easily trainable beasts and used them as cheap slave labor in their mines, but when Republic xenosociologists studies the Eloms, it became apparent they were sentient.

Over the objections of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]], the Republic enforced treaties that gave the Eloms territorial rights to the both the underground tunnels and the lands above them. [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]] resentment soon passed, however, in the face of the open-armed acceptance they enjoyed from the peaceful, unsophisticated Eloms. Further, the Eloms had no interest in becoming involved with the offworld business dealing of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]], but were content with living as they had for countless centuries. For the most part, the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]] were more than happy to leave the Eloms to their caves.

The attitudes of many Eloms changed slightly when the Empire revoked all treaties established by the Republic on [Elom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)) and enslaved the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]] to mine lommite. Young Eloms in particular were disturbed by the Imperial troops mistreatment of their neighbors, so they started to fight to free their world. Initially, the Eloms merely liberated a few [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/elomin.md|Elomin]] from isolated mine shafts, but after [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) sent commandos to help the Eloms, entire slave camps vanished into the Elom cities hidden at the center of deep labyrinths.

Following the creation of [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), a number of young Eloms left their underground lives to seek their fortune on their homeworld's surface or even among the stars.

### Elom Characteristics
**Personality:** Eloms are ambitious and highly intelligent, but they often underestimate the capacity for evil that exists in other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). They are frequently manipulated into becoming involved with illegal activities. Eloms are generous, easygoing, quick to forgive, and eager to learn useful skills and trades.

**Physical Description:** Eloms are stocky mammalian bipeds with oily fur and layers of fat designed to capture moisture. Their hands and feet have hooked claws that are optimal for digging, and they have prehensile toe on each foot. Their small, round eyes are sensitive to bright light and are set at the far extremes of a wide face dominated by two rock-hard, sharp tusks and thick jowls that the Elom use to store excess food. They are sturdy beings that average 1.4 meters tall as adults.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Eloms age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-17 Years | 18-49 Years | 50-65 Years | 66-89 Years | 90+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The cold, mineral-rich desert world of [Elom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elom_(Planet)), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Language:** The structure of the Elom mouth makes it difficult for them to speak Basic (Requiring an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) score of at least 14 to speak it), but reading and writing are far easier to them.

**Example Names:** Broig, Gossof, Oront, Qurgg, Skona, Trugbuz, Ukskul.

**Adventurers:** Eloms who are taken away from their homeworld become or remain [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) (Almost exclusively thugs in the employ of criminal organizations). The few adventuring Eloms tend to be [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels).

Eloms share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers: **All Eloms receive a +2 bonus to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom).
