*Zuguruk Species data created by Wikia user Crinoshunter.*

Zuguruk are a lesser known subspecies of the Sith. Like the other subspecies of the Sith, the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/kissai.md|Kissai]] and the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]], they are native to the world [Korriban](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban). The Zuguruk are the Engineers of [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith), and the second highest of the caste system. The Zuguruk oversee the building of the Sith Burial Mounds and Battleships, as well as serving prominent [Sith Offshoots](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Offshoots) to coordinate and manage large and complicated construction projects.

Due to their greater precision and attention to detail, Zuguruk were respected to a great degree despite their lack of physical strength. "Behind a great Sith is an army of Zuguruk" was once a well-known phrase on [Korriban](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban), as after a great conquest it was the Zuguruk that rebuilt the cities for their masters.

### Zuguruk Characteristics
**Personality:** The Zuguruk tend to be a bit harsh towards others, especially when they are interrupted from doing their work, or distracted from their designs.

**Physical Description:** The Zuguruk skin tends to span between hues of crimson and obsidian. Unlike other tridactyl subspecies of Sith, a Zuguruks' hands end in five digits, allowing for greater precision in their work. Adult Zuguruk typically stand between 1.8 and 2.0 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Zuguruk age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-15 Years | 16-30 Years | 31-45 Years | 46-59 Years | 60+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The ancient Sith world of [Korriban](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban), resettled later to [Ziost](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ziost).

**Languages:** Zuguruk speak and read the ancient language of the Sith, and learn Basic to better manage blueprints and documents for their masters.

**Example Names:** Grathuk, Kalmnr, Zyurn.

**Adventurers:** The Zuguruk rarely leave their place of birth, spending most of their lives working indoors on blueprints or in workshops crafting more personal items. Particularly successful Zuguruk might travel within [The Sith Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith_Empire) to oversee major military projects. As such, Zuguruk are almost exclusively [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians), with a rare few Zuguruk [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles).
