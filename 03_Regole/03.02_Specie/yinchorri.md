When the Yinchorr System was first charted five centuries before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), explorers found it resource-poor and unworthy of colonization. Further, the Yinchorri were deemed too primitive to be any great boon to the Republic. So, they were largely ignored until a year before the Invasion of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo), when they officially joined the Republic. They gained interstellar travel capabilities, most likely from stolen technology, shortly after their admission into the Galactic Senate.

Slavers quickly learned to avoid the Yinchorr System, as the Yinchorri made terrible slaves- they tended to fight to the death rather than be enslaved, while individuals were so uncooperative that they either starved themselves to death or had to be put down.

Until shortly before the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), the Yinchorri lived in city states, with each community fielding its own any and having its own leaders, usually a Council of Elders. Each city-state had a number of satellite communities that grew food and mined resources for the central city, and a city's power was measured by how many smaller settlements are needed to keep it supplied. For many centuries, Tol-Kachorn was the mightiest of ail Yinchorri city-states, with nearly one hundred villages and five other cities and attendant communities under its rule. Other cities occasionally tried to equal or rival Tol-Kachorn, which led to brutal campaigns of conquest. Followed by widespread chaos in the region once the emerging empire collapsed.

The Yinchorri initially went unnoticed and undisturbed by the Emperor's New Order; as the system contained few resources, no one felt the need to call attention to the obstinate Species that dwelled there. The one exception- and one of Yinchorr's greatest tragedies- was when the system's Imperial governor decided the Yinchorri could serve as the perfect bait in a plot to capture Princess Leia (and advance his career past a dead-end posting ln a useless star system). He captured the leaders of the various Yinchorri Councils of Elders and offered to trade their lives back to the Yinchorri in exchange for Leia. The Yinchorri people felt that the life of one [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] was an adequate price for their beloved eiders, so they set a trap for the Rebel leader. When the governor tried to double-cross the Yinchorri, the angry natives overthrew him and his regime.

After becoming fully aware of the evil of the Empire, the Tol-Kachorn Council of Elders threw their support behind [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance). As the Rebellion established bases in the Yinchorr System, other Yinchorri city-states offered their warriors and Starships to the fight as well.

The Empire punished the Yinchorri for their revolt. The sector's Moff, with the full blessing of the Imperial High Command, ordered a massive assault against [Yinchorr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr), and shortly after the fall of Echo Base on [Hoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hoth), the Rebel bases in the [Yinchorr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr) system were leveled. The cities of Yinchorri were also pounded to rubble by orbital bombardments- even the long history of mighty Tol-Kachorn ended that day. The surviving Yinchorri were reduced to living as nomadic tribes. The devastation on [Yinchorr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr) came to the Emperor's personal attention a few months later, and shortly before the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) he ordered all training facilities of his elite personal guard to be consolidated in that system. [Yinchorr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yinchorr) remained under Imperial domination until nearly a decade after the destruction of the Yinchorri cities; the system was liberated by New Republic forces as part of the campaign to reclaim the territory seized by the forces led by what was reportedly the Emperor's clone.

The surviving Yinchorri came together under the banner of the last son of the leader of Tol-Kachorn's Elder Council. They have since settled in the heavily defended complex once used as the headquarters of the Emperor's Imperial Guard and are currently trying to rebuild their civilization. Yinchorr remains an independent star system into [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era). While the system continues to host a New Republic military base and a small Starship repair facility, the Yinchorri have not yet applied for membership in [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic).

From the moment they hatch, the Yinchorri join tightly knit, highly supportive communities- first their parents and clutchmates, later the entire village they grow up in, then their professional peers and superiors, and finally, a family of their own. When a Yinchorri mates, he or she does so for life, and it is quite common for a widowed individual to die from sorrow within a few days of losing his or her spouse. While the Yinchorri have taken to space travel, few have settled off their homeworld. Those who have, however have brought their entire extended family with them, essentially transplanting entire villages at a time.
