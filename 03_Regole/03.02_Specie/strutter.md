*Strutter Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker.*

A species of sentient avians, Strutters inhabit scattered villages across [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), where they use mirrors to admire themselves as they groom their flamboyant plumage. Strutters place great importance on their trendiness and style, and don't refrain from critiquing the comportment of others. This behavior makes Strutters come off as extremely vain to [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), and has given the avians a reputation for silliness and witlessness. However, while Strutters place an overly great emphasis on seemingly unimportant features, they still hold a keen intelligence and possess a refined attention to detail; indeed, their manufacturing of their handheld mirrors alone marks them as one of the most advanced civilizations on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

### Strutter Characteristics
**Personality:** Strutters have definite ideas about what was considered chic or unstylish and don't not refrain from telling even total strangers what they feel about their taste. Strutters have an infatuation with artistic expression, leading them to constantly seek out the latest trends.

**Physical Description:** Strutters have svelte bodies with blue legs and beaks, and are covered in pink feathers, accented by tufts of yellow at both ends of the neck and on either side of the head. Their tails, too, are bushy and yellow; it's remarkably flexible, allowing Strutters to wag it as they preen.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Strutters age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-20 Years | 21-54 Years | 55-79 Years | 80-94 Years | 95+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Strutters live in scattered villages on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), each one dedicated to a particular type of craftsmanship.

**Languages:** Struttese uses tonal coos and hoots to express vivid descriptions of speech.

**Example Names:** Dignity, Perfume, Regality, Vibrance.

**Adventurers:** While less common than [Jindas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jindas), traveling Strutters are a welcome sight to [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), as they're always willing to sell their masterful craftsmanship. Such Strutters are either [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), depending on how honest their work is, with a rare few Strutter [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) that take the wilderness of the Forest Moon more seriously.
