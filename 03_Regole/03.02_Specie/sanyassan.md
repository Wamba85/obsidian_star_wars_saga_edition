*Sanyassan Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Most [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) know the Sanyassans as aggressive warriors and brawlers, famed for their strength and temper and lack of deep thought. Their history hints at eras in which Sanyassan society was much more advanced than the might-makes-right kleptocracy found on their homeworld during the time of the Republic, the Rebellion, and beyond. Although technologically primitive by galactic standards, the warlike Species stole the secrets of space flight and are taking to the stars with expansionist zeal. Sanyassan hunting parties like to prey upon the peaceful inhabitants of [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), and [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) shudder at the horrible tales of the "Demons from the Dark Star."

These barbaric space marauders have been pests in the outer part of the Moddell Sector for as long as anyone can remember. The homeworld is host to a billion surly Sanyassans, most of whom crave getting to the stars.

Sanyassans ruthlessly prowl the Moddell Sector in their scavenged ships, attacking anyone who crosses their path and stealing whatever new technology they can salvage from razed colonies and the wrecks of enemy ships. Other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) take advantage of the Sanyassans' vicious nature, arming them with the latest weapons and employing them as thugs, bodyguards and shock troops.
