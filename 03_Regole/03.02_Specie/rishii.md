*Rishii Species data created by reddit user robanglican.*

Rishii are an avian [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) native to the tropical world of [Rishi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rishi). Their interactions with offworlders is limited, due to their obscure planet's placement (The last stop of a minor Hyperspace route). During [Rishi’s](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rishi) frosty season, the Rishii rely on energy from exonium stones to help them prepare food. Rishii had little interest in technology, and the items they traded with outsiders are usually used to decorate their nests. However, they are intrigued by what they called “Shiny Rocks” (Spacecraft) which allowed beings without wings to fly. Even when entering combat against advanced foes like [The Confederacy of Independent Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems), the Rishii fought using [Spears](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Spear) and [Axes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Axe), rather than adopting more powerful weaponry.

### Rishii Characteristics
**Personality:** The Rishii are known for their friendly attitude towards outsiders, despite living in the extragalactic Rishi Maze. Family groups live together in open-air nests built on cliffs and perches, and members of the tribe live and work together peacefully. They respect members of other tribes who came to visit them, and also the offworlders that colonized the humid lowlands.

**Physical Description:** Rishii possess an owl-like appearance, with a pair of large wings. At the ends of these wings, they had talon-like hands with opposable thumbs. They are excellent hunters, and swoop down at very great speeds from cliffs to catch rodents in their lower talons. They possess a long, thin tail with a tuft of feathers at the tip.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Rishii age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-6 Years | 7-10 Years | 11-39 Years | 40-64 Years | 65-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The lush and tropical world of [Rishi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rishi), at the end of the Rishi Maze in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** The Rishii have a talent for mimicking language. They often copy the voices and movements of other beings, much to the annoyance of the person being copied. The Rishii, however, enjoy using their talents.

**Example Names:** Gwarrk, Nazish, Qaraah, Arankau.

**Adventurers:** Rishii that leave Rishi often find themselves fascinated by galactic technology, and their curiosity leads them to find work on Starships or on major [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds) such as [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) or [Alderaan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaan). Force-sensitive Rishii have be known to visit obscure [Force Traditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Traditions), and studying their lore and history.
