The Empire subjugates the Talz very early in [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times). The New Order wasted no time in secretly enslaving the race and forcing them to mine the mineral wealth of [Alzoc III](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alzoc_III). The Talz do not understand the motives of their new masters, but they can do little but comply. Those few Talz who escape must hide themselves along the fringes of the galaxy, lest the Imperials send them back to their homeworld. During this time, almost no one in the galaxy knows that the Talz even exist.

Although primitive, the Talz are quick learners and take to technology quite well. Their two sets of distinctive eyes allow them to see at all times- one set works in bright light, the other in total darkness. Their thick fur is suited to the frigid temperatures of [Alzoc III](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alzoc_III).

### Talz Species Traits
Talz share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Talz receive a +2 bonus to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence). Winters of [Alzoc III](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alzoc_III) make the Talz strong and resilient, but they have had little chance to learn and develop intellectually.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Talz have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Talz have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** Talz learn how to use technology very quickly. A Talz who has [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Mechanics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Mechanics)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).

When a Talz makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of Slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Talz are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Talz can speak, read, and write Talz.
