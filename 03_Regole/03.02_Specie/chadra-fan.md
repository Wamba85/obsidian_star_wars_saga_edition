Known for being among the most cheerful and friendliest beings of the galaxy, Chadra-Fans are found in many places. On their native world, hurricanes and tsunamis frequently wipe out their homes, so the Chadra-Fans have developed an intense fear of water and choose new homes on arid planets. This experience with frequent destruction also leads them to regard few things as being truly permanent. Chadra-Fans embrace the moment and enjoy themselves as much as they can, living with a contagious zest for life.

Chadra-Fans are notorious for their love of tinkering, frequently disassembling and reassembling unattended devices into something different. Chadra-Fans find work in industrial research, and conventionally trained engineers attempt to duplicate Chadra-Fan creations.
