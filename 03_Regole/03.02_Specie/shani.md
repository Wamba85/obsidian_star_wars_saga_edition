*Shani Species data created by Wikia user Halcyontraveler.*

An enigmatic species from the far reaches of [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim), Shani are rarely seen among the galactic community. This rarity only adds further mystique to a species with a frightening appearance and deadly reputation.

Among the earliest bounty hunters in galactic history, Shani are notorious for their predatory habits, in particular their ability to devour creatures of up to their own size whole and alive. While many Shani are kind and reasonable individuals, those that indulge these appetites give the entire species a deadly reputation, and most Shani conceal their brightly-colored feather crests in turbans in order to hide their species and keep those around them at ease.
### Shani Characteristics
**Personality:** Shani vary wildly in personality, though their long lives and carnivorous natures often make them less empathetic towards other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**Physical Description:** Shani are scaly green-skinned humanoids. Their heads are topped by crests of brightly colored feathers, but their features are otherwise reptilian, with slitted pupils and a snakelike jaw. A typical Shani male stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs 75 kilograms, while a typical Shani female stands at 1.6 meters tall and weighs 55 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Shani age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-15 Years | 16-25 Years | 26-350 Years | 351-600 Years | 600-800 Years | 801+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The origins of the Shani are unclear to historians, but most agree they came from somewhere in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** Due to their living on the fringes of the galaxy, Shani are typically fluent in Huttese. Most also learn Basic as they grow older.

**Example Names:** Crukibolt Nart Adeen, Deva Lompop, Glenna Kip.

**Adventurers:** Shani adventurers are usually [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), as a result of their Species' close association with [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics), but their heightened strength makes them deadly [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) as well.
### Shani Species Traits
Shani share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Shani gain a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) score. Shani are more physically powerful than their frames would suggest.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Shani have no special modifiers due to their size.
- **Speed:** Shani have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bonus Feat:** Shani receive the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/pin.md|Pin]] feat at 1st level as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Extraordinary Recuperation:** A Shani regains Hit Points at double the normal rate (see [Natural Healing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Natural_Healing)).
- **Lockbite:** A Shani that makes a successful [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) attack can automatically latch onto a target with its teeth, giving the Shani a +5 bonus to subsequent [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) checks against the target.
- **Low-Light Vision:** Shani ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (but not [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness.
- **Natural Weapons:** A Shani has a Natural Weapon, in the form of unhinging jaws and sharp teeth. When a Shani makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Shani are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Shani can speak, read, and write Basic and Huttese.
