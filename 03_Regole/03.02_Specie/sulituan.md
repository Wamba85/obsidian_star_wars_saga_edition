*Sulituan Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Sulituans are an amphibious species of egg-laying scavengers. Their quick reflexes lead some to become successful as podracers.
They are one of the galaxy's oldest sentient species, having existed on their homeworld of [Archae Teuthis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Archae_Teuthis) for millions of years, though they have only possessed spaceflight for a small fraction of that time.
