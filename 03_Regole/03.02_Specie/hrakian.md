*Hrakian Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001 (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

Tough fighters and avid spacers whose hulking transports are common sights throughout the Vorzyd Cluster, Hrakians aren't a sophisticated Species socially or technologically. They show little interest in galactic politics.

Give them a job to do with the promise of credits and a boisterous cantina at the end of the task, and they're happy. Although their homeworld remains the central hub for trade with neighboring [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), Hrakian colonies exist throughout the Vorzyd Cluster, and Hrakians intermingle easily with the other species of the commonality.
### Hrakian Characteristics
**Personality:** Hrakians are daring and interpid beings known for their reliability and perserverance. They prefer simplicity over complexity, and though they can accomplish a great deal when they set their minds to a task, their sometimes lazy or lackadaisical nature often leads them to choose the easiest route or solution.

**Physical Description:** Hrakians have feathery ruffs that crown their bald skulls and eye ridges in lieu of hair. They average 1.8 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Hrakians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-44 Years | 45-69 Years | 70-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Hraki](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hraki), a planet in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) dominated by jagged, soaring mountains and dense, steaming jungles.

**Languages:** Hrakians read, write and speak Hrakian, which has evolved to incorporate a lot of Basic syntax and idioms, so much so that few Hrakians feel the need to learn Basic as a separate language.

**Example Names:** Drex Vahgur, Gruxl Obbin, Hathox Greb, Thazhia Yexel.

**Adventurers:** Hrakian adventurers are scattered throughout [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). They can take levels in any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class), although Hrakian [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) are rare (and highly prized by Hrakian ship captains).
