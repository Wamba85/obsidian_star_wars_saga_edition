*Kalduu Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001 (Converted from its Alien Encounters counterpart).*

The Kalduu are jellyfish-like creatures native to [Ropagi II](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ropagi_II). They float on air and often travel in groups of three, moving in complete silence. Kalduu eat airborne bacteria as well as germs and viruses from their hosts, and breathe in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen. Reproduction is done by fission. The average Kalduu lives for around 500 years.

Kalduu can form a group mind if two or more of the creatures are within 60 metres (40 squares) of one another. A group mind shares their thoughts in seconds, no words or gestures need be included.

The Kalduu have developed a symbiotic relationship with [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) and [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans), providing intellectual and medicinal services and consuming harmful viruses from their host's system through their tentacles.

The Kalduu dwell on the rooftops of many of the buildings on Ropagi II, though they avoid the Offworder's Quarter. In times of inclement weather, the Kalduu are allowed to enter houses to seek shelter.
### Kalduu Characteristics
**Personality:** The Kalduu are peaceful beings, preferring to live in harmonious symbiosis with their humanoid hosts.

**Physical Description:** Kalduu have transparent, hemispherical bodies and four tentacles streaming from underneath.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Kalduu age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-49 Years | 50-99 Years | 100-299 Years | 300-399 Years | 400-499 Years | 500+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Ropagi II](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ropagi_II), a high-tech ultra-pacifist world in the [Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Expansion_Region).

**Languages:** Lacking vocal cords, the Kalduu communicate entirely by telepathy. The Kalduu do not maintain any written records of their history, feeling that dwelling on the past is a waste of time. 

**Example Names:** The Kalduu do not have a spoken language. Their "names" are more like individual sensations, such as colours, images, sounds, smells, or emotions. Examples include "Lime green", "Fluffy clouds", "A humming noise in E minor", "Petrichor", and "Sonder".

**Adventurers:** Kalduu adventurers are commonly [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).
### Kalduu Species Traits
Kalduu share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Kalduu receive +2 bonuses to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), and [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). Kalduu are perceptive and agile, but physically weak.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Kalduu gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Kalduu have a base Fly Speed of 2 squares. Kalduu cannot walk, and use flight as their only method of locomotion.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** Kalduu move silently in groups. A Kalduu with [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/covert-operatives.md|Covert Operatives]] as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Flight:** Kalduu are capable of flight, but cannot do so if they are carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Hive Mind Communication:** A Kalduu can mentally communicate with any Kalduu within a 60 metre (40 square) range.
- **Limited Telepathy:** In conjunction with their hive mind and technological methods of communication, Kalduu are able to employ a weak form [Telepathy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telepathy) that allows them to convey simple feelings and thoughts to any willing recipient within 10 squares.
    - Kalduu can use the [Telepathy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telepathy) aspect of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained) (even if not Force-sensitive). If the target of the [Telepathy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telepathy) is within 10 squares, no skill check is required to initiate the telepathic contact.
- **Mute:** Kalduu have no vocal cords, and must rely on a combination of sign language, computers, and [Telepathy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telepathy) in order to communicate with others. When they learn new Languages, they can understand but not speak them.
- **Symbiont Circle:** Once per encounter a Kalduu can activate the *[Vital Transfer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vital_Transfer)* Force Power, using their [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) modifier in place of a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check.
    - A Kalduu who takes the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-training.md|Force Training]] feat automatically adds a single use of any one Force Power with the *[Light Side]* descriptor to their [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) (for free) instead of this ability.
- **Automatic Languages:** Kalduu can understand, read, and write Basic.
