Cereans are a sophisticated and cultured humanoid Species native to [Cerea](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cerea), a world on the fringes of known space. Their elongated heads distinguish them from most other humanoid [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

Cereans established contact with the rest of the galaxy shortly before the Galactic Republic was transformed into the Empire, swiftly gaining fame as expert astrogators, cryptographers, and economists. Few patterns or trends escape the notice of a Cerean.

Cerean society is matriarchal, and the Cerean culture's traditional values emphasize living in harmony with nature and minimizing any impact on the environment from technology. The peaceful philosophies of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) appeal to Cereans, and many join the Order.
### Cerean Characteristics
**Personality:** Cereans tend to be calm, rational, and extremely logical.

**Physical Description:** Cereans average about 2 meters tall, with elongated craniums housing binary brains. They have a maturity rate and life span similar to those of [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans).

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Cerean male stands at 2.0 meters tall and weighs 78 kilograms, while a typical Cerean female stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs 58 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Cereans age at the following stages:

**Example Names:** Ki-Adi, So Leet, Sylvn, Ti-Dal, Maj-Odo.

**Adventurers:** Cereans who become adventurers do so in spite of their peaceful traditions. Still, when a cause or situation leads down this path, a Cerean tries to keep these traditions intact, avoiding aggression when possible. The binary brain allows a Cerean to constantly weigh both sides in any disagreement and give two points of view equal consideration. This ability extends even to issues surrounding [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), and a Cerean [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) often contemplates [The Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Light_Side) and [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) simultaneously.

### Cerean Species Traits
Cereans share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** Cereans have a +2 bonus to both their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity).
