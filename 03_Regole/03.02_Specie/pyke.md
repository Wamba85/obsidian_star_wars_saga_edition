*Pyke Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty.*
An infamous Species most well known in the galaxy for [The Pyke Syndicate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pyke_Syndicate), a criminal organization with major investments in the spice mines of [Kessel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kessel). The Pykes unsettling appearances, with large heads and small faces, puts other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) on edge.

The Pykes are insular, and unwelcoming to non-Pykes. On [Oba Diah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Oba_Diah), most visitors are heavily monitored by the criminal elements, and few are willing to serve them as customers. During the reign of the Empire, corrupt Imperial Moffs allow the Pykes' economic investments (Spice) to bolster their economy into a golden age. Said age continued for years after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), as [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) lacked the resources to crack down on their illicit trade.

### Pyke Characteristics
**Personality:** Pykes are insular and xenophobic, unwelcoming to outsiders. Those out of [Oba Diah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Oba_Diah) with [The Pyke Syndicate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pyke_Syndicate) hold other Species in disdain, and rarely hold their lives with any sort of value.

**Physical Description:** Humanoid in appearance, Pykes are thin and tall with long limbs and fingers. Their heads are excessively elongated and tapered with proportionally small faces, a feature most other sensients find unsettling. Their skin tones are often dull green with more brightly colored eyes, often hidden behind face masks. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Pykes age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-40 Years | 41-59 Years | 60-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Pykes hail from [Oba Diah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Oba_Diah), a terrestrial planet marked by obsidian cliffs. Visitors to [Oba Diah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Oba_Diah) are viewed by the population unwelcomingly, and the terrain is difficult to navigate.

**Languages:** Pykes speak Pyke, a deceptively soothing tongue that belies the conversation's sinister contents. With how frequently exposed to galactic life the Pykes are, most learn Basic at a young age.

**Example Names:** Fife, Laalee, Marg Krim, Tezzka Krim, Lom Pyke, Quay Tolsite, Vram.

**Adventurers:** With their connections to the underworld and, more specifically, [The Pyke Syndicate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pyke_Syndicate), most Pykes fit well into the roles of [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles). [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) are also fairly common, but [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) far less so. If Force-users have existed, they are not known to the galaxy.

### Pyke Species Traits
Pykes share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Pykes receive a +2 bonus to [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Pykes are cunning and manipulative, but hold a poor reputation within the galaxy.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Pykes have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Pykes have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Deceptive:** Naturally cunning and convincing, a Pyke may choose to reroll any [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Mental Fortitude:** A Pyke gains a +2 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) and [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks, being extremely savvy in a variety of illicit fields.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Pykes can speak, read, and write both Basic and Pyke.
