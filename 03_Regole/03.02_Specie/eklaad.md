The scattered tribes of Eklaad are ruled by hereditary chieftains.

The Eklaad have nothing more advanced than bows and spears.
### Eklaad Characteristics
**Personality:** Eklaad are vegetarians, and are naturally timid and non-aggressive. When confronted with danger, their first response is to curl up into an armoured ball and wait for the threat to go away. Their second response is to flee. Only if backed into a corner with no other choice will an Eklaad fight, but in such cases they will fight bravely and ferociously. Since almost all their experience with offworlders has come from the Empire's soldiers, Eklaad are very suspicious and wary.

**Physical Description:** Eklaad are short, squat creatures, typically ranging from 1-1.5 meters in height. They walk on four hooves, and have elongated, prehensile snouts ending in four digits. Their skin is covered in a thick armoured hide, which individuals decorate with paint and inlaid trinkets.
