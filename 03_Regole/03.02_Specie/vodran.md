*Vodran Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Vodrans, like the [Klatooinians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Klatooinians) and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/nikto.md|Nikto]], are a humanoid Species permanently indentured to the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts). More than 25,000 years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), [The Hutt Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Empire) challenged a galactic tyrant named Xim the Despot for control of the Si'klaata Cluster. [The Hutt Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Empire) sent ambassadors to [Vodran](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vodran_(Planet)), [Kintan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kintan), and [Klatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Klatooine) in search of powerful allies. On [Vodran](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vodran_(Planet)), what they found instead were technologically primitive [Dianoga](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dianoga) hunters and fisherfolk living in thatched huts. The Vodrans believed the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) were terrible gods and immediately bowed to their will.

After defeating Xim, the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) subsumed the Vodran homeworld into their stellar empire. The Vodrans have served their [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/hutt.md|Hutt]] masters loyally ever since. [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/hutt.md|Hutt]] culture quickly supplanted the Vodran way of life, The Vodrans created their own miniature Kajidics, imitating the clan structure of their sluggish overlords. Each Vodran clan answers to a powerful Hutt Kajidic. and though [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) gave Hyperspace technology to their Vodran servants, few Vodrans would dare travel abroad without first seeking permission from their [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/hutt.md|Hutt]] masters.

Few Vodrans possess sufficient individuality to reject the tenets of their society, but they are treated as outcasts. Sorne [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) will hire bounty hunters to hunt down these freethinking traitors, while others could care less about the loss of one useless Vodran servant.

### Vodran Characteristics
**Personality:** Vodrans are simple-minded beings who lack individuality, believing in the well-being of the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) regardless of how many Vodrans must die to protect that well-being. Unlike their [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/hutt.md|Hutt]] masters, Vodrans partake of few, if any, diversions. They have trouble mastering complex social behaviors such as etiquette or innuendo.

**Physical Description:** Humanoid, with leathery brown skin. black featureless eyes, a flat nose, and a face ringed by horny protrusions, the average Vodran stands about 1.75 meters tall. A Vodran's underdeveloped facial muscles permit only a slight range of facial expressions.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Vodrans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-16 Years | 17-44 Years | 45-64 Years | 65-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Vodran](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vodran_(Planet)), one of many inhabited worlds in the Si'klaata Cluster (located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim)), is a jungle world infested with predators and scavengers, including the loathsome [Dianoga](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dianoga). Many [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) make their homes on [Vodran](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vodran_(Planet)), breaking the backs of their Vodran servants to maintain their opulent lifestyle.

**Languages:** The [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) eradicated the Vodrans' ancient language millennia ago. Huttese is now the Vodrans' native language.

**Example Names:** Kl'ietu Mutela, Lakren Plooru, Meido Lycri, Saran Yydek, Xenon Nnaksta.

**Adventurers:** Vodrans are normally encountered outside of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/hutt.md|Hutt]] service only when they are sold to others. Occasionally, a Vodran overcomes his or her social conditioning and inbred inclination to obey authority. Other members of the Species treat these freethinking individuals as renegades and lunatics. Vodran heroes are typically [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), or [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), although Force-users are also possible.
