Aleena are a small reptilian Species best known as galactic travelers. Their inborn curiosity coupled with strong dedication to family inspires them to tour most any part of the galaxy together. Aleena families show up even in the most unusual or dangerous locales, just to see the sights. However, although "Galactic Tourist" might be the Aleena stereotype, they also engage the galaxy in more civic ways. In the Republic, Aleena served in the Galactic Senate, and as Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters. Squads of Aleena [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) even helped to defend [Kashyyyk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyyyk) during the Clone Wars. In the Empire, the Species has not garnered any special attention.

Aleena are quick and agile. Their metabolism allows them to burn a lot of energy in a short amount of time, giving them a significant boost to their speed and reflexes. Some Aleena use these natural skills as Podracers and pilots.
