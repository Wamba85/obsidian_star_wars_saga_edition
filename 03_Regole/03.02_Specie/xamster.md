A reptilian species from [Xagobah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Xagobah), Xamsters rarely leave their homeworld, preferring to stay close to their bonded Malvil-Trees. The Xamsters are known for being lean, strong and agile athletes, often being recruited for their quick reflexes to sports like pod racing.

Many Xamsters are conscripted by the Grand Army of the Republic during the sixteen month-long Battle of [Xagobah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Xagobah).
### Xamster Characteristics
**Personality:** Xamsters live in communities deep within the fungal forests of their homeworld. They coexist symbiotically with Malvil-Trees, which they use to sustain and shelter their families.

**Physical Description:** Xamsters are squat bipeds covered in loose folds of scaly skin ranging in pigmentation from purple to green and yellow. Their heads are dominated by two bat-like ears that stand erect at both sides of their elongated, high-domed skull.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Xamsters age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-15 Years | 16-40 Years | 41-54 Years | 55-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Xagobah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Xagobah) is a an Outer Rim world covered in a perpetual purple mist, home to all manner of fungi and pollen spores.

**Languages:** Xamstan is a language of sharp clicks and guttural growls.

**Example Names:** Neva Kee, Xeran.

**Adventurers:** Xamsters can best use their natural advantages to leverage their skills as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), with their quick reflexes making them exceptional pilots. Several make more grounded careers as podracers instead, wherever the sport is legal.
