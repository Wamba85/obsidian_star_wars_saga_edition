*Pho Ph'eahians Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Pho Ph'eahians are rarely seen away from their homeworld, [Pho Ph'eah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pho_Ph'eah). They bear a passing resemblance to [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chadra-fan.md|Chadra-Fan]], although their greater size, blue fur, and extra set of limbs quickly set them apart. Pho Ph'eahians inhabit the mountainous regions or their homeworld. Their four arms are ideal for scaling rocky crags, and their thick fur enables them to withstand cool temperatures.

When the Republic first made contact with the Pho Ph'eahians more than a thousand years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), the Species had already developed nuclear fusion, repulsorlift technology, and spaceships with sublight drives. By dismantling and rebuilding [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive)-capable Starships given to them by the Republic, the technically minded Pho Ph'eahians were able to build their own [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) technology, making a few refinements along the way. Since harnessing the means to leave their home star system, Pho Ph'eahians have been encountered in every corner of the civilized galaxy. Corporations and spaceports, particularly in [The Corporate Sector](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Corporate_Sector), frequently employ Pho Ph'eahians as engineers.
### Pho Ph'eahian Characteristics
**Personality:** Most Pho Ph'eahians are outgoing and cheerful. They enjoy being the center of attention. They view their bodies as "Sacred manifestations of the Spirit" and clean themselves religiously to ensure that stains on their bodies do not become stains on their souls. Aside from their cheery dispositions and obsession with deadlines, Pho Ph'eahians are best known for their technical skills.

**Physical Description:** Pho Ph'eahians are a bipedal, four-armed humanoid Species with bright blue fur and large fanlike ears. The average Pho Ph'eahian stands about 1.7 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Pho Ph'eahians age at the following stages:

| 1-11 Years | 12-16 Years | 17-45 Years | 46-65 Years | 66-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Pho Ph'eah](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pho_Ph'eah), an Outer Rim world near [The Corporate Sector](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Corporate_Sector). The planet's distant elliptical orbit keeps it far from its native sun most of the time. During these "Dark" periods, the sun appears as a distant speck in Pho Ph'eah's sky, and the Pho Ph'eahians must rely on their thermal layer of fur to keep them warm.

**Languages:** Pho Ph'eahese is a sophisticated language of squeaks, squeals, and high-pitched barks. Written Pho Ph'eahese uses an intricate set of characters that represent single spoken syllables.

**Example Names:** Cho'ree, Darshev, Fe'heon, Garv, Le'shar, Lo'pho'r, Rova, Shev, Veerzan, Vo'ray.

**Adventurers:** Pho Ph'eahians prefer to remain on their homeworld, though they have been attracted by lucrative jobs as engineers and mechanics, especially throughout [The Corporate Sector](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Corporate_Sector). Pho Ph'eahian heroes are usually [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), although they can belong to any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class).
