*Quork Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

A Species of sentient, furry, horned humanoids found on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), Quorks are burly creatures known more for brawn than brains. Nevertheless, they are apt warriors who employ their militant skills and domesticated [Devil Beasts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Devil_Beasts) against [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), particularly aggressive against the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), the Quorks' sworn enemies. They inhabit rugged cities carved into the rocky mountains of the Forest Moon, and follow a strict martial hierarchy with the strongest leading their people as their King.
### Quork Characteristics

Quork [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) are tolerated and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are too few to be well understand by the warrior culture, but a Quork [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) or [Scoundrel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel) is viewed as a coward and liability to their community.
