*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Species Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Species_Sourcebook)*

The Quor'sav are warmblooded creatures native to the planet [Uaua](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Uaua) in the Ua System of The Centrality, and possessing both avian and monotreme characteristics. They stand on stilt-legs with long-necks, bills and brightly colored plumage. They are oviparous, and their eggs take over a year to hatch. At some point in their history, [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] colonists introduced a virus to [Uaua](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Uaua) that was deadly to avians (But only carried by mammals). As a result, the Quor'sav neither trust nor welcome non-avian offworlders on [Uaua](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Uaua), and have a maligned past with The Centrality itself. Quor'sav have shown physical weakness to some airborne pollutants, including several present on [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant).

Due to their unique appearance, Quor'sav are also often subjected to insults from members of other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**Physical Description:** The Quor'sav are warmblooded creatures possessing both avian and monotreme characteristics. Quor'sav can manipulate their feathers to express emotion and aid communication.
