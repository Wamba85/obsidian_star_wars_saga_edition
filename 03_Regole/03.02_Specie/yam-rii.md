*Yam'rii Species data created by Wikia user AiserLaran.*

Hailing from the [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space) planet of [Huk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Huk_(planet)), the Yam'rii, also known as the Huk, are an aggressive insectoid Species that clashed with the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/kaleesh.md|Kaleesh]] some years prior the beginning of the Clone Wars. Some xenobiologists have hypothesized a possible link between this Species and the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/verpine.md|Verpine]].

### Yam’rii Characteristics
**Personality:** Yam’rii are often viewed as ruthless predators that constantly crave eating meat and eggs, including those of other sentient Species. This stereotype is alimented by the brutal exploitation made by the Yam’rii planetary government towards neighbouring sectors, including the [Kalee](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kalee) sector. Despite this negative view, some Yam’rii have managed to successfully integrate themselves in the Galactic civilization as diplomats, merchants and bounty hunters.

**Physical Description:** The Yam’rii are an insectoid Species that resemble giant praying mantises, sporting triangular heads with big eyes, slender bodies covered by a robust carapace and very long upper limbs ending with sharp claws. Adults stand on average between 1.9 and 2.3 meters tall, with no significant differences in build between males and females.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Yam'rii male or female stands at 2 meters tall and weighs 75 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Yam’rii age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-4 Years | 5-9 Years | 10-40 Years | 41-60 Years | 61-80 Years | 81+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Huk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Huk_(planet)), a planet covered with dense forests located in [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space).

**Languages:** Yam’rii speak their own language of Yam’rii. Most of them learn also Sy Bisti because it constitutes the most common commercial language spoken within their region of the Galaxy. They can also learn to speak Basic, though they speak it with a raucous ghostly-sounding voice.

**Example Names:** Kitik Keed'kak, Rek, Sylar Saris.

**Adventurers:** Yam’rii are a versatile Species. Most Yam’rii adventurers tend to be [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), although [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) aren't unheard of. No Yam’rii Force-users are known to exist, at least not as members of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi).

### Yam’rii Species Traits
Yam’rii share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Yam’rii receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Yam’rii are strong despite having slender builds, but they are aggressive and quick to anger, while their appearance and their culture are considered disturbing by most other Species.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Yam’rii have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Yam’rii have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Carapace:** Yam'rii gain a +1 Natural Armor bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +1 Natural Armor bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). A Natural Armor bonus stacks with an Armor bonus.
- **Cold-Blooded:** Yam’rii are very sensitive to cold climates. A Yam’rii takes a -5 penalty to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) to resist [Extreme Cold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold).
- **Natural Weapons:** A Yam’rii has Natural Weapons in the form of sharp claws. When making an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, a Yam’rii can choose to use Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage. Yam’rii are always considered armed when attacking with their Natural Weapons.
- **Reach:** Unlike most Medium-sized [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), Yam’rii have a natural [Reach](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reach) of 2 squares.
- **Sneaky:** A Yam'rii can choose to reroll any [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check to sneak, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Unusual Physiology:** members of the Yam'rii [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) have either clippers or two-fingered claws in place of hands. Because of this, a Yam'rii suffers a -5 penalty to any attack roll, skill check, or ability check when using [Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons) and hand-held [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) not designed for their [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). This penalty does not extend to [Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Armor), [Clothing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clothing) and other pieces of [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) that are worn rather than wielded, with the sole exception of all kinds of gloves ([Combat Gloves](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Combat_Gloves), [Cortosis Gauntlets](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cortosis_Gauntlets), [Shield Gauntlets](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Gauntlet), [Shockboxing Gloves](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shockboxing_Gloves), [Stunning Gauntlets](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stunning_Gauntlet), [Vibroknucklers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibroknucklers)) and other items that cover the hands. [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) specifically designed for beign wielded by Yam'rii is [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare) outside [Huk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Huk_(planet)), and Non-Yam'rii suffer a -5 penalty to any attack roll, skill check, or ability check when using it.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Yam’rii can speak, read and write both Yam’rii and Sy Bisti.
