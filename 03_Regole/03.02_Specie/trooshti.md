*Trooshti Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

The Trooshti are a rare species of flying insect native to [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine).  They live in colonies centred around the planet's few remaining oases of water, and have been known to swarm into vast, fast-moving columns in order to deter predators.

### Trooshti Characteristics
**Personality:** Trooshti are shy of larger creatures and usually remain close to their hives. However, Trooshti can venture further afield in search of prey when necessary. While thought of as animals or merely semi-sentient by most of the planet, Trooshti are secretly accomplished engineers, capable of maintaining mechanical water pumps to sustain their hives.

**Physical Description:** With their four wings and sharp eyesight, trooshti are experts at preying on smaller insects. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Trooshti age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-4 Years | 5-8 Years | 9-26 Years | 27-28 Years | 29-30 Years | 31+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine)

**Languages:** Trooshti speak their own insectoid language. They are capable of understanding, but not speaking, the languages of other sentients. Likewise, most non-insectoid species cannot learn to speak Trooshti. While Trooshti can read, they do not usually learn to write as well.

**Example Names:** Individual Trooshtis cannot communicate their names to non-Trooshtis, if indeed they have such a concept. As such, individual Trooshtis are often referred to by nickname. Examples include "Kiluyak" (Jawaese for "cloud"), "Pateesa" (Huttese for "friend"), "Scabwit" (a Gamorrean insult), and "Uli-ah" (Tusken for "child").

**Adventurers:** Trooshtis do not communicate well with other species, and are often forced to get by as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), despite usually having pure intentions. Trooshtis also make for good [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). No Trooshti are known to have become [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).
### Trooshti Species Traits
Trooshti share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Trooshti gain a +2 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and a -4 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution).

- **Flight:** Trooshti are capable of flight, but cannot do so if they are carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Primitive:** Trooshti do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
