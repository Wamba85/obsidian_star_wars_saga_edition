The Bitthævrian are a strong warlike Species of bipedal mammals originating from the [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space) planet of [Guiteica](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Guiteica), located in the Kadok Sector.
### Bitthævrian Characteristics
**Personality:** Bitthævrian culture is based on personal combat skill and absolute respect for their leaders. The status of a Bitthævrian is based on his or her personal skill as a fighter, with the greatest warrior becoming the leader of their people. Bitthævrians are highly isolationist, going so far as to start a war against [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) due to the latter's perceived interference within their space.

**Physical Description:** Bitthævrians are tall bipedal mammals characterized by heavily muscled bodies, flat faces sporting long narrow eyes and nostrils and six protruding fangs. Their bodies are also characterized by having six-fingered hands with a couple of thumbs each and by having sharp quills covering their elbows and knees that are used in personal combat as piercing weapons. They have thick leathery skin that protects them from physical damage, ranging in colour from sandy pink to tan, rusty brown, dark brown and black. Bitthævrians' vision ranged into the infrared, allowing them to see heat sources in complete darkness.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Bitthævrian male or female stands at 1.9 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Bitthævrians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-13 Years | 14-45 Years | 46-60 Years | 61-75 Years | 76+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Guiteica](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Guiteica), a harsh planet located in [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space).

**Languages:** Bitthævrian speak their own language of Bitthævrian and they also learn to speak Sy Bisti.

**Example Names:** Aul Tarrus Vishav, Jael Ganton Farvash, Quaal Tavier Catharius, Zoul Minchov Dwæer. 

Every Bitthævrian has three or four names. The first name of a Bitthævrian was the season when he or she was born, thus the choice is restricted to Giil, Quul, Aul, Zoul, Tweil, Jael or Quaal. The second name was the family name, which was inherited from the mother's maternal surname. Furthermore, a male Bitthævrian adopted a third name when married: his wife's surname. The fourth name (third in females and single males) was the Bitthævrian's personal name, used normally only as a form of familiar address, by friends, family, and cohorts.

**Adventurers:** Giving the warlike nature of Bitthævrian society, most Bitthævrian tend to become [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). Because the unforgiving environment of Guiteica, [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) are also a common sight. [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) are rarer but not unheard of, especially among Bitthævrian leadership and elders, while [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) are in many cases outcasts exiled from [Guiteica](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Guiteica). No Bitthævrian Force-users are known to exist.
