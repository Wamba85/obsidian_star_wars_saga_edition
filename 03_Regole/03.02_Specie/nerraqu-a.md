*Nerraqu'a Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

The Nerraqu'a are an endangered species on the edge of extinction. They are also known by the derogatory term "Mongo Beefheads".

During their prime, the Nerraqu'a inhabited [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine)'s oceans before they were boiled away by [Rakatan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Infinite_Empire) bombardment. Their decline has been further accelerated over the millenia by attacks from depraved [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side) cannibals, who consider their meat a delicacy, despite its poor nutritional content.

The surviving Nerraqu'a form tribal groups in the deserts of [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine), often relying on alliances with other groups for survival.
### Nerraqu'a Characteristics

**Physical Description:** Nerraqu'a possess a crown of four tentacles, making them somewhat resemble [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/quarren.md|Quarren]] with upside-down heads.
