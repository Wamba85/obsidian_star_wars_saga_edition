*Yokaa Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

The Yokaa are a largely undocumented Species of six-eyed, serpentine sentients native to [Pasaana](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pasaana). Yokaa appear to share a common ancestor with the [Vexis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vexis), another species of six-eyed serpent. Yokaa are poorly adapted to the heat of Pasaana's deserts and usually keep to the shade of the planet's underground caverns, only venturing outside in heavily armoured vehicles.
### Yokaa Characteristics
**Personality:** Most Yokaa keep their social interactions with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to a minimum, using few words when not negotiating a price or transaction. Due to this, little is known about Yokaa' societies.

**Physical Description:** A Yokaa's most distinguishing features are their serpentine bodies and a pair of luminous, tri-lensed eyes. Yokaa also tend to have a short mane of fur, often dyed in bright neon colours.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Yokaa age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-30 Years | 31-49 Years | 50-69 Years | 70+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The desert dunes and underground caverns of [Pasaana](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pasaana).

**Language:** Yokaa tend to speak both Basic and Bocce.

**Example Names:** Kalo'ne, Kha'bin, Nur'bek, Vhu'sr, Yul're.

**Adventurers:** The Yokaa's keen insight often makes them successful gamblers, and some leverage that advantage in the wider galaxy as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).
