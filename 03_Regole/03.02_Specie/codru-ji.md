The Codru-Ji have long been isolated from the rest of the galaxy. Highly xenophobic, they are reluctant to grant members of other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) access to their society. Though they do not fear other cultures, they are concerned that outsiders will somehow "rub off" on them and corrupt their own traditions and values.

Certain aspects of Codru-Ji culture is barbaric by galactic standards. Ritual kidnapping, especially the children of political rivals, is common. Though victims are generally returned unharmed, the experience can be frightening and offputting to non-Codru-Ji. Visitors to [Munto Codru](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Munto_Codru) are warned that they should never travel alone, lest they fall victim to abduction. Offworlders abducted by Codru-Ji in this manner are often forced to pay a ransom, either in the form of valuables or political favors.

All Codru-Ji possess six limbs: four arms and two legs. In addition, juvenile Codru-Ji hardly resemble their parents as much as they resemble small, furred, hexapedal canines.
