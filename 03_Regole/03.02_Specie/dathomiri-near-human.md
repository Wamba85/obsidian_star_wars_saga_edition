*Homebrew Reference Book: [Dathomir Field Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir_Field_Guide) - Species*

Dathomiri, or Dathomirians, are a hybrid near-Human species native to the Outer Rim world of Dathomir comprising the genes of female Humans Nightsisters and enslaved Zabrak men. Dathomirian females tend to have pale gray or white skin, blue eyes tall, thin, athletic bodies and no vestigial horns. Males (or "malelings") more closely resemble Zabraks, muscular and powerfully built with colorful skin and sharp horns. All specimens on Dathomir are Force-sensitive due to the genetic Force-sensitive component of the female Human Nightsisters who helped breed the sub-species.

Dathomiri are a tribal people, and tend to use dark side magic. They worship the Fanged God and the Winged Goddess and enslave many immigrated Zabrak men to do their biddings.
