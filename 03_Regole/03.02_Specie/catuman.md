*Catuman Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Catumen are sapient felinoids known as fierce mercenary warriors. Catuman warriors are raised in the art of warfare from birth, and are said to be among the deadliest killers in the galaxy, with many serving as elite bodyguards to powerful individuals across the galaxy. Catumen are speculated to be the predecessors of several other felinoid species, such as the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/farghul.md|Farghul]] and the [Zygerrians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zygerrians). These Species refute such claims emphatically, feeling that Catumen's short lifespans and lower intelligence are a sign of a lesser Species, barely removed from the common household [Loth Cat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Loth_Cat).
