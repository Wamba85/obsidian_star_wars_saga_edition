The Zabrak are an early spacefaring race distinguished by patterns of vestigial horns on their heads. Zabrak hail from many worlds and have been spacefarers for so long that they define themselves and each other according to their colony of origin.

The harshness of [Iridonia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iridonia), their homeworld, forged in the Zabrak an iron will to survive. Driven to escape their world, they sought to obtain the knowledge of space flight. When [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/duros.md|Duros]] scouts began exploring [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim), they encountered Zabrak in eight sovereign colonies in five different systems. Though subjugated under the harsh rule of the Empire, the Zabrak colonies eventually regained their independence.

Zabrak posses a great amount of confidence, and they believe that there is nothing they can't accomplish. While this innate attribute could lead to feelings of superiority, most Zabrak don't look down on others. They believe in themselves and are proud and strong, but they rarely project any negativity toward those of other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
