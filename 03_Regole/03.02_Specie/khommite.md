*Khommite Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Khommites are a Species of clones created from a Species that stopped developing over a thousand years ago. At that time, the Khommites believed that their civilization had reached its apex, and no further improvement was possible. Rather than risk the degeneration of their supposedly perfect culture, they decided to ensure nothing ever changed. Cloning eventually replaced live births entirely. Since the existing balance of professions was considered ideal, each clone would take over the duties of its predecessor.

Absolute conformity resulted. Cities were laid out on grids, and buildings were built in boxlike shapes. If something began to suffer the ravages of wear and tear, it was replaced with a perfect replica. Creativity and free thought became undesirable, and eventually foreign.

The highly organized way of life on [Khomm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Khomm) changed when a Khommite named Dorsk 81 discovered they were capable of sensing [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). When they left their world to study at Master Skywalker's academy, other Khommites considered them a borderline lunatic. They fully expected them to eventually return to their old duties, but Dorsk 81 had other plans. The Khommite homeworld was later attacked by a fleet of powerful Imperial ships and suffered massive destruction. After such a powerful blow to their carefully ordered society, many Khommites reconsidered the benefits of pure conformity without innovation. Since then, a few have left [Khomm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Khomm) to follow the example of Dorsk 81.
