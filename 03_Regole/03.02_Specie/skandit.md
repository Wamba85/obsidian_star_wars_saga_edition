*Skandit Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

A Species of small, sentient bipeds inhabiting the forest clearings of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), Skandits are known for their raiding parties that ambush caravans of unwary travelers. Skandit raiders drop from their elevated trees with their capes acting as gliders, using their ionic wooden baton with a single, white, round head tied onto one end. Skandits also fight with whips and slingshots. The Skandits initially overwhelm the surprised target with numbers, before grappling them down and keeping the targets isolated from one another.

Once their victims surrender, the Skandit brigands march them back to their settlements and intern them in makeshift cells using the root systems of nearby trees. Although they have a propensity to attack non-Skandits, communities do receive certain visitors of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) peaceably. Most notably the traveling [Jindas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jindas), but some traders also sell their wares to the Skandit settlements.
### Skandit Characteristics
**Personality:** Despite their fierce demeanor and aggressive attitudes, Skandits are easily frightened by superstition and uncertain danger; they tend to freeze up in such conditions, only the bravest able to push through their fear.

**Physical Description:** Skandits are furry bipeds with squat, pudgy bodies and thin, lanky limbs. Skandits are covered in blue-gray fur with a long, bushy tail and a mask-like band of black fur growing around each eye and across the back of their heads.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Skandits age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-14 Years | 15-29 Years | 30-42 Years | 43-54 Years | 55+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Skandits live in the spacious clearings of the less dense regions of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), forming small villages in the trees themselves.

**Languages:** The Skandits are noisy creatures, and speak a fast-paced language of chitters, growls, and screeches in their high-pitched voices.

**Example Names:** Chatbu, Mocktree, Pulsnet, Zipset.

**Adventurers:** A Skandit's penance for ambushes and trickery serves them well as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are a somewhat common role as well. Skandit [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) might lead villages during more peaceful periods, but [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are an infrequent and coveted position among the raiding Species. 

### Skandit Species Traits
Skandits share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Skandits receive a +2 bonus toÂ their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Skandits are capable combatants, but are cowardly in the face of the unknown.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Skandits gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Skandits have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Skandit with [Jump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jump) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Jump)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Jump)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Deathstrike:** Whenever a Skandit makes a melee attack against an opponent that is denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), the Skandit's attack, if successful, deals +1 die of damage.
- **Primitive:** Skandits do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
