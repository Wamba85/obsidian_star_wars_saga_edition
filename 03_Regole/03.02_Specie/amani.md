These arboreal humanoids live in small tribes that each lay claim to one of the many sparse forests of [Maridun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maridun), their homeworld. When a tribe grows too large, the younger adults set out to claim a new forest. The arrival of the Empire on [Maridun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maridun) went largely unnoticed, until one Amanin lorekeeper agreed to turn over prisoners from rival tribes as slaves. Not long after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), operations on [Maridun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maridun) were taken over by [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) and various criminal syndicates, which constructed spaceports to support the growth of several small cities populated by crime lords, scoundrels, consortiums, mining companies, and Amanin slaves.

As their society becomes more and more integrated with the rest of the galaxy, Amanin become more comfortable with space travel and technology, though they lack the scientific knowledge to build technology of their own. Amanin collect various trapping of their rich history, such as trinkets and trophies.

### Amani Characteristics

**Homeworld:** [Maridun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maridun), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim), is a temperate world of long, flat plains dotted with small forests. During the Galactic Civil War, the Empire constructed several spaceports on [Maridun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maridun) to support their mining operations. These spaceports have been co-opted by smugglers, slavers, and pirates as bases of operation since the Empire's defeat.

**Adventurers:** Amanin are relatively new to the civilized galaxy. After the dissolution of the Galactic Senate, many have begun living in the spaceports of [Maridun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Maridun) and traveling offworld. Each new generation of Amanin is more integrated into galactic society than the previous one. Amanin heroes are usually [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).
