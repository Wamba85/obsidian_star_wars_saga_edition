*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Species*

Vuvrians are ubiquitous throughout the galaxy, usually functioning in sales, business administration or as some sort of ambassador or negotiator. Originally from the tranquil world of [Vurdon Ka](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vurdon_Ka), Vuvrians evolved on a planet with few threats. The world's weather patterns only experience an annual fluctuation of fifteen degrees, and the Vuvrians have very few predators in their ecosystem, and food is plentiful. Perhaps because of their lack of hardships, Vuvrians have always been extraordinarily easy to get along with. 

Of course, it had been suggested that Vuvrians would understand other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) better if they learned about the suffering of the average galactic citizen. This view has caused many Vuvrians to leave for planets with harsh climates such as [Tatooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine) or [Pantora](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora), where temperature extremes wreak havoc on their sensitive skin. Many of these Vuvrians pay this penance in hopes to enhance their understanding of other beings, thereby making them better equipped to work on their behalf. 

### Vuvrian Characteristics

**Personality:** Vuvrians are incredibly skilled at interpersonal relations, combining an outgoing and friendly nature with a willingness to please and politeness. Their skills have helped them distinguish themselves in the fields of sales and diplomacy, overcoming what most mammalian humanoids find to be an off-putting visage. Vuvrians are used to being judged by their looks, and are usually able to change a being's mind within a single encounter. 

**Physical Description:** Vuvrians are tall, thin insect-like humanoids with saucer shaped heads featuring a dozen eyes spread evenly, and two drooping antennae. Many wear environmental suits to dull their sensitivity in extreme weather. 

**Average Height/Weight: **A typical Vuvrian stands at 2 meters tall and weighs about 80 kilograms. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Vuvrians age at the following stages:

**Homeworld:** [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim) world of [Vurdon Ka](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vurdon_Ka), a dim lit forested planet.

**Adventurers:** Vuvrians are typically [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), preferring to avoid combat. Vurvian Force-users occur in normal percentages, and they have been counted as members of [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order).
