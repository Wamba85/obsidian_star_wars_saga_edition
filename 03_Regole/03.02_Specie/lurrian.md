*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

Lurrians are short, furred humanoids native to the frigid world of [Lur](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lur). Seemingly of simple herbivore stock, Lurrians evolved by banding together into extended family units. By grouping together they could defend themselves from the many dangerous predators of their world. Eventually, true intelligence developed. With social evolution and intelligence came knowledge of the nature of their planet.

While their world lacked readily accessible resources like metals or wood, [Lur](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lur) had an abundance of lifeforms, both animal and plant. The Lurrians learned to domesticate certain creatures. They began by taming creatures for food, then transportation, then construction. Eventually, they learned that selective breeding could bring about desirable traits. In time, the Lurrians discovered many natural herbs, roots, and compounds that, when administered to females ready to breed, could bring about dramatic changes in the genetic code of offspring.

Now, these beings have a very advanced culture based on their knowledge of genetic manipulation. While they lack technological tools, many of their newly developed lifeforms perform the functions of these tools. Swarms of [Asgnats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Asgnats) burrow subterranean cities in the glaciers; herds of [Grebnars](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grebnars) provide meat; [Noahounds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noahounds) guard the cities. The Lurrians have bred creatures whose sole purpose is to cultivate genetic code altering plants and herbs or to consume the wastes of their culture.

While genetic manipulation is strictly controlled due to the atrocities of the Clone Wars, there are still those who seek genetic experts. The Empire has quarantined the world due to the Lurrians' abilities, but little effort is made to enforce the quarantine. Some resort to enslaving them to acquire their services.
