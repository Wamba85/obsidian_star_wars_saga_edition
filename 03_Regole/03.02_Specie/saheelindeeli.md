*Saheelindeeli Species data created by Wikia users Darthauthor and Droidscotty (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

These gregarious humanoids are descended from primates, and when necessary, they drop to all fours to cover ground as quickly as possible. Most live quietly but happily in matriarchal clans as farmers or ranchers, although some have left their homeworld seeking wealth, fame, and excitement elsewhere in the galaxy.

Saheelindeeli like to incorporate customs from other worlds into their own society. The high festival on the Saheelindeeli homeworld- a time for tribal hunting rituals and harvest ceremonies- has recently begun to incorporate rate farm machinery exhibits, shock-ball matches, and air shows in an attempt to reflect the Saheelindeeli's growing technological sophistication.

Not all Saheelindeeli have found happiness among the stars. Some are menial laborers on [Desevro](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Desevro), where they endure poverty and the contempt of the Desevrars.
