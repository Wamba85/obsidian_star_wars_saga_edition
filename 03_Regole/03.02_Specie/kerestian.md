*Kerestian Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Kerestians have a reputation across the galaxy as relentless hunters. The Species developed atomic power and sublight drives but never perfected [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) technology.

More than a millennium before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), the Kerestian sun entered an unusual cycle of activity that caused temperatures on [Kerest](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerest), the Kerestian homeworld, to plummet. Only a thin ribbon of land near the planet's equator remained untouched by glaciers. Several groups of Kerestians evacuated the system in sublight vessels, searching for a new home. Those who remained reverted to barbarism and began hunting one another for food and sport. A few escaped the frigid wastelands of [Kerest](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerest) aboard the vessels of visiting explorers. During [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era), a few Kerestian hunters even found their way into the service of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) and [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance).

The Kerestians who fled their homeworld aboard sublight vessels entered suspended animation. Unable to enter Hyperspace, many of the ships fell prey to shipwide malfunctions and deep-space collisions, but at least one of these "Lost" colonies of Kerestians has been found adrift and revived. Unlike their barbaric descendants, these Kerestians are civilized, highly disciplined, and articulate.

### Kerestian Characteristics
**Personality:** Kerestians from present-day [Kerest](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerest) are brutal, civilized beings who do whatever is required to survive. They live for the hunt and slay anyone who stands in their way. In sharp contrast, "Lost" Kerestians are civilized and compassionate beings who are saddened by the near-destruction and regression of their society.

**Physical Description:** Kerestians are tall, broad-shouldered humanoids with pale skin, slit-pupiled eyes (Usually emerald-green), and twin manes of long, thick hair. Other notable facial features include a series of air holes running along each cheekbone, a single nostril that joins with the mouth, and low, featureless ear holes. Kerestians stand about 2.15 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Kerestians age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-17 Years | 18-44 Years | 45-57 Years | 58-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Kerest](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerest), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). A thick sheet of glacial ice covers all but a strip of land near the planet's equator.

**Languages:** Kerestese is an intricate language, having many unique rules and exceptions. The written form uses an equally complex alphabet.

**Example Names:** Anzella, Galasett, Meergolo, Milacass, Ossune, Sallabas, Andov Syn.

**Adventurers:** Kerestians who tire of languishing in the frigid wastelands of Kerest usually find work offworld as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers)-of-fortune, mercenaries, and bounty hunters. “Lost” Kerestians are more interested in art, diplomacy, and exploration and make good [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble). 

### Kerestian Species Traits
