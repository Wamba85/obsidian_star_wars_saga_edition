Vurks are an amphibious Species from the planet [Sembla](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sembla). Their way of life is based on a nomadic lifestyle, as large family units move en masse cross Sembla's watery surface. They transition easily from the depths of Sembla's warm seas to the heights of its rocky, volcanic archipelagos. Vurk families rarely stop in any one spot for more than a fortnight at a time.

When two or more Vurk clans meet during their constant migration, the families of these clans stop and hold a mutual feast. Tests of strength, speed, and wits are commonplace, as are arranged marriages and commerce. Young males are married off by their parents and leave to be with their wives and their new families. Male Vurks who fail to marry before reaching adulthood remain bachelors for the rest of their lives.

Originally considered a primitive Species by galactic survey teams, Vurks are intelligent and philosophically advanced. From birth, they are taught to honor personal integrity, individual freedom, and honesty. Because of these tenants, Vurks make excellent diplomats and negotiators.

### Vurk Characteristics
**Personality:** Known for their even tempers, compassion, and personal integrity, Vurks abhor lying. They take their duties, whether to family, friends, or nation, seriously. Because of this, others consider them somewhat blunt and stern.

**Physical Description:** Vurks are tall, reptilian amphibians with leathery gray-green skin. Their eyes are dark and set deep in their faces. A long crest extends up and back from a Vurk's skull. A Vurk has two long, thick fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Vurk male stands at 2.1 meters tall and weighs 90 kilograms, while a typical Vurk female stands at 1.9 meters tall and weighs 85 kilograms.

**Homeworld:** The watery world of [Sembla](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sembla), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). It is a planet filled with shallow warm oceans and volcanic island chains.

**Languages:** Vurk speak their native tongue of Semblan, a gluttenal language as effective underwater as it is overland.

**Example Names:** Coleman Trebor, Sweitt Concorkill, Wunitt Fodor.

**Adventurers:** Vurks who leave their homeworld tend toward the path of the [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) or [Soldier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier). A handful of Vurk [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) make their way to the stars as diplomats, but given the Species' ingrained integrity, few Vurk are [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels).
