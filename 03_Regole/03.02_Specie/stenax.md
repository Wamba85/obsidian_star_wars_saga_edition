*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Edition Infinities Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Edition_Infinities_Campaign_Guide)*

The Stenax are a fierce, ill-tempered, and violent race from the craggy and desolate world of [Stenos](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stenos). The Stenax are an incredibly spiritual people, and follow the dictates of their god Vol. This devotion is so great that despite their capabilities for flight, the Stenax refuse to take to the air after the stone idol of Vol was lost in the days of [The Old Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic).

The Stenax are also extremely insular, caring little for other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) and cultures that come to their world. While they don’t persecute those newcomers, neither are they welcomed, and interactions between Stenax and visitors are rare and brief.

### Stenax Characteristics

**Personality:** A reclusive Species, Stenax are violent and brutal when provoked, but generally ignored off-worlders entirely. When forced to interact with others, a Stenax is typically short-tempered and impatient.

**Physical Description:** Tall and thickly muscled, Stenax have gargoyle-like faces and a row of bony spikes running across their shoulders. Three sharp claws punctuate each foot, five on each hand, with additional spikes lining the backs of their calf muscles. Stenax have scaly, purple-gray skin and white eyes with miniscule pupils.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups): **Stenax age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-13 Years | 14-44 Years | 45-62 Years | 63-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Stenax hail from the craggy and desolate world of [Stenos](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stenos), in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). The planet is home to rocky deserts and vertical cities.

**Languages:** Stenax is spoken by the Stenax as a grumbling baritone by most of the populace. Due to their insularity, few Stenax bother to learn the off-worlders’ languages.

**Example Names:** Farruz, Helmurath, Vol.

**Adventurers:** Stenax are most at home as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), in rare occasions a [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) Stenax may be encountered. Few Stenax ever leave Stenos, making them a rare sight to behold.
