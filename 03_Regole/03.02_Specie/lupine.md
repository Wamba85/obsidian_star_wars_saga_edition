*Lupine Species data created by Wikia user Widow46.*

The Lupine are a Species of bipedal sentients from [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories), near the border of Republic Space. They have lupine lower legs, with high ankle joints and three-clawed feet. The Lupine have pointed ears and gray skin, with red eyes and sharp teeth. Members of the Lupine typically don cowls to obscure their heads.

During [The Mandalorian Wars](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorian_Wars), their homeworld was conquered by Mandalorian forces under control of [Rohlan Dyre](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rohlan_Dyre), a commander of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders who was trying to escape the army so as to discover the true motivation of the Mandalorian expansion. He killed many of the Lupine while making his escape. A couple of members were caught on the surveillance tapes of [Eejee Vamm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eejee_Vamm) while the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/duros.md|Duros]] was searching for [Gorman Vandrayk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gorman_Vandrayk). Later, at least one Lupine was part of [The Taris Resistance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Taris_Resistance) after the planet was conquered by [The Mandalorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians). He was present when [Shel Jelavan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shel_Jelavan) attacked [Zayne Carrick](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zayne_Carrick) on his arrival at the Resistance base.
