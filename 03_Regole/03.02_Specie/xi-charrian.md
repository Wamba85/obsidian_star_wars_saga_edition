Best known for their precision engineering, the Xi Charrians are from the bleak plateaus of [Charros IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charros_IV). Exhibiting a religious devotion to their craft, the Xi Charrians live in factory-cathedrals where they focus on their specialty, be it engraving, welding, microelectronics, or any number of other mechanical and electrical disciplines.

The Xi Charrians are perhaps most well-known for the Haor Chall Engineering Corporation, which supplies the Trade Federation with their variable-geometry Droid Starfighters.
### Xi Charrian Characteristics
**Personality:** Hard work was the same as prayer to Xi Charrians; when a member becomes injured, they voluntarily exiled themselves so that no others would witness their imperfection. Xi Char factories double as religious cathedrals, teaching that all life is a shadow of the paradise of the afterlife, and that creating machines allows glimpses of the afterlife.

**Physical Description:** Xi Charrians' short bodies are covered in chitinous plates, and stand quadrupedal, with pointed, "scissor-action" feet. Xi Charrians' heads are teardrop-shaped with red eye-slits.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Xi Charrians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-6 Years | 7-16 Years | 17-44 Years | 45-59 Years | 60-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Xi Charrians are native to [Charros IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charros_IV), located in the Charros System of [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim), just outside of [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim).

**Languages:** Xi Char uses a complex variety of clicks to convey clear messages amongst Xi Charrians; other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) have difficulty understanding the language, and most are incapable of speaking it.

**Example Names:** G'grak'tlasa'ak-s, K'naanar-s, Th'laagog-s, T'laalak-s'lalak-t'th'ak, T'tikilak-th'sakak-l'ch'ak, Vl'buurur-s, Y'nao'paak-s.

**Adventurers:** Rogue Xi Charrian engineers can often be found in the fringes of the galaxy, using their technical expertise to great effect. Most all Xi Charrians act as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), to make the most of their mechanical abilities.
