*Shadda-Bi-Boran Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

A peaceful sun-worshipping civilization, the Shadda-Bi-Boran are dependent on a unique form of radiation produced by their star, Shadda, to produce a purifying enzyme needed to survive.

Tragedy struck the Shadda-Bi-Boran in 43 BBY when it was discovered that Shadda was cooling into a white dwarf and would soon undergo a supernova. Because the Shadda-Bi-Boran thrived on radiation emitted by the star, they could not be evacuated to just any world.

The Shadda-Bi-Boran's plight soon became a galactic *cause célèbre*, and the Refugee Relief Movement attempted to locate planets with similar stars to relocate the Shadda-Bi-Boran; a young [Padmé Amidala](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Padmé_Amidala) assisted in relocating one such colony. However their efforts were in vain; entire colonies died off within months due to their failure to adapt.

[The Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) made a last offer to the Shadda-Bi-Boran to put them in stasis or to be [frozen in carbonite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Carbonite_Freezing_Chamber) until a new home could be found, but it was refused. The last of the species died in 38 BBY.
