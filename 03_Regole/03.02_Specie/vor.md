*Vor Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Vors are a peaceful avian Species that doesn't wish to get involved in galactic politics. Vors prefer a simple life. Their homes are half buried in the ground to withstand their homeworld's powerful winds.

The Vors use their keen aesthetic sense to build architectural wonders of otherworldly beauty and elegance. Their most cherished accomplishment- the physical and spiritual center of their homeworld- is the Cathedral of Winds. This intricate crystalline structure stands several hundred meters tall and is riddled with flutelike apertures or blowholes. By covering and uncovering the holes with their bodies in perfect order, Vors can create ethereal music that wafts across the plains. Once per year, the Vors perform a concert like none other in the galaxy. A concert at the Cathedral of Winds is special event, and the Vors consider it their highest honor to perform in the concert. The Vors refused to perform their music for offworlders during the reign of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) and have only recently allowed [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) and other dignitaries to attend these shows.
