*Talortai Species data created by Wikia user Halcyontraveler.* 
The Talortai are a rare Species, rarely seen in the galaxy but instantly recognizable by their towering stature and avian appearance. Though once deeply spiritual, they have since become insular and reclusive, fearful of drawing attention to their innate [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]]. 

More than twelve hundred years before the rise of the Empire, the Talortai's homeworld of [Talor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talor) was invaded by [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith), who saw their universal [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] as a threat to their rule over [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions). The Talortai were decimated, with only a small fraction of the Species surviving. In response, the Talortai withdrew to their homeworld and restricted the use of their Force abilities, living with simple technology and shunning those who sought to further understand their Species' unique connection to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).

### Talortai Characteristics
**Personality:** Talortai tend to be aloof and serious, carrying with them the long trauma of being an endangered Species. They avoid making their thoughts and feelings visible, remaining on-guard against those who could exploit them. 

**Physical Description:** Talortai are tall, avian humanoids covered in a mix of knobby scales and soft, downy feathers. Their heads are large, with powerful, heavy beaks and small, dark eyes. Their hands are tipped in claws, as are their bulky, columnar feet. Â 

**Average Height and Weight:** Talortai stand tall, but their highly pneumatized bones make them surprisingly lightweight. An average Talortai male stands at 2 meters and weighs 60 kilograms, while a typical Talortai female stands at 2.2 meters and weighs 75 kilograms. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Talortai age at the following stages: 

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-40 years | 41-75 years | 76-300 years | 301-800 years | 801-2,000 years | 2001+ years |

**Homeworld:** [Talor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talor), a world stagnant in its traditional society.

**Languages:** The isolation of the Talortai means few learn Basic or other languages, instead using their own language of Talortai.

**Example Names:** Aru, Endi, Ila, Jadi, Nalu, Suma, Udi, Urai, Zondi.

**Adventurers:** Talortai rarely leave their homeworld by choice. Those encountered as adventurers tend to be exiles who violated their elders' strict traditions and were cast from their homes as a result. Though Talortai are not inherently immoral, the desperation of these loners often drives them into unsavory company that promises to replace the kinship and community they have lost.

### Talortai Species Traits
Talortai share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Talortai receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence). While they are physically powerful, Talortai are rarely given access to education as a result of their traditionalist society.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Talortai have no special bonuses or penalties based on their size.
- **Speed:** Talortai have a base speed of 8 squares.
- **Bonus Feat:** Talortai receive the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat at 1st level as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Fast Healing:** Whenever a Talortai takes its [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind), it regains 5 Hit Points every round at the end of its turn until killed, the end of the encounter, or until reaching one-half Hit Points (whichever comes first).
- **Natural Weapons:** A Talortai has Natural Weapons, in the form of razor-sharp claws. When a Talortai makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of Slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. A Talortai is always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Weapon Familiarity:** Talortai treat the [Wingblade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wingblade) as a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee)) instead of as an [Exotic Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Melee)).
