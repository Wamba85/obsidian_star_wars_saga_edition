*Fleebog Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Fleebogs are a Species of tiny, sentient beings characterized by blue skin, red eyes, and a yellow shell. They inhabit mazes of tunnels beneath the surface of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), using domesticated insects as beasts of burden and lighting for their tunnels. Despite their close proximity to [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ewok.md|Ewok]] settlements, Fleebogs have largely avoided [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), suffering from an acute inferiority complex due to their severely smaller sizes and hold a societal fear of larger predators.

### Fleebog Characteristics
**Personality:** Fleebogs have developed a great fear of larger creatures because of their constant endangerment by larger predators. While their communities are tightly bound, they still suffer from paralysis of indecision in moments of stress.

**Physical Description:** A Fleebog is hairless and blue, with a striated and red belly and tail. Their backs sport a round, yellow shell with black spots, with two thin antennae and pointed ears on their high-domed heads framing their slanted, pupilless eyes.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Fleebogs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-3 Years | 4-6 Years | 7-18 Years | 19-24 Years | 25-29 Years | 30+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Fleebogs live beneath the surface of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), remarkably close to the tree villages of the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks).

**Languages:** Fleebogs speak their own language, though local leader also take the effort to learn Ewokese should it prove necessary.

**Example Names:** Elania, Henna, Imhotep, Shelob, Sticker.

**Adventurers:** Fleebogs excel as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), using their talents to quickly outmaneuver their foes without their notice. Very few are [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) or [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) given their fear of direct combat with larger creatures, and the Fleebogs' inferiority complex of their size makes them too quick-tempered to act as effective [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles).
### Fleebog Species Traits
Fleebogs share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Fleebogs suffer -4 penalties to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Fleebogs struggle to socialize with outsiders, and are greatly vulnerable to physical threats.
- **Diminutive Size:** As Diminutive creatures, Fleebogs gain a +5 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +15 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are one-quarter of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Fleebogs have a base speed of 2 squares.
- **Animal Handler:** A Fleebog can choose to reroll any [Ride](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ride) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse. Additionally, a Fleebog can make [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks to change the [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of an undomesticated creature that has an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) score of 2 or lower.
- **Fearful:** Fleebogs suffer a -5 penalty to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) to resist Fear effects, as well as against the [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) application of the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill.
- **Primitive:** Fleebogs do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Solitary Weakness:** Being so used to others sharing the load, any item a Fleebog carries on their own is considered a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Fleebogs can speak Fleebog. They have no written form of their language.
