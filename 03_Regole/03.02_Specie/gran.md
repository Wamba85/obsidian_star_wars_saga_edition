Gran originally came from the world and system of [Kinyen](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kinyen) in [The Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region). They are longtime members of galactic society, with numerous colonies. Although most of these colonies are peaceful, their colony on [Malastare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Malastare) quickly became embroiled in a bitter conflict with the native [Dugs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dugs), forcing the Gran to act aggressively to protect themselves.

Gran place society over self, and they receive training that complements both their personal talents and society's needs. The desire to maintain balance within society caused the Gran to establish alien-only areas of [Kinyen](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kinyen). This was intended to restrict alien influence and avoid trouble between [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), such as what happened on [Malastare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Malastare). During [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times), the Empire has pushed the Gran leadership to grant access to all areas. When the Gran refused, [Kinyen](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kinyen) was subjected to orbital bombardment. The [Kinyen](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kinyen) Gran relented, but the incident inspired many Gran to resist the new Empire.

### Gran Characteristics

Gran friendships are for life. Gran from [Malastare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Malastare) and other colonies follow looser social codes than those from the homeworld .

**Physical Description:** The beige-skinned Gran have three distinctive eye stalks with pitch-black eyes, ahead of small horns and large, triangular ears. Males and females have similar builds.

Prior to [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times), Gran [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) were common, and it is possible that some survived the initial Jedi Purge.
