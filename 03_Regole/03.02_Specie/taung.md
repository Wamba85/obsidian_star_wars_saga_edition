The Taung are warriors first and foremost, having battled the native [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] nations for control of [Coruscant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coruscant) before being driven off and forced to flee to the Outer Rim world of [Roon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Roon), where they remain for millennia until the legendary Mandalore the First leads them to conquer another world. Taung rename both the world and themselves in his honor, becoming [The Mandalorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians).

With a clan-based nomadic culture, Taung view battle and war as both a source of personal honor and a way to show pride in their community. Veterans of successful battles are held in high regard, to such an extent that they are the de facto leaders of their communities. Only the leader of all [The Mandalorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorians), known simply as Mandalore, holds greater sway with the clans.
