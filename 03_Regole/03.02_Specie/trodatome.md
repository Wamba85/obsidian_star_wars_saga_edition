*Trodatome Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Trodatomes have largely been left alone by galactic powers such as the Hutts and the Empire, with most would-be conquerors seeing little value in the subjugation of a Species of limbless blobs. While Trodatomes are relatively helpless in combat, however, their high degree of intelligence makes them valued as scholars and mechanics.

Many attempts have been made to create a form of [Cybernetic Prosthesis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cybernetic_Prosthesis) compatible with Trodatome biology, but all attempts at installing cybernetic limbs on a Trodatome have thus far failed.
### Trodatome Characteristics
**Personality:** Trodatomes are generally easygoing and pleasant to be around, but have a tendency to panic and react poorly to stress.

**Physical Description:** Trodatomes are strange, blob-like creatures with no arms or legs. They use a pair of flippers to shuffle around and possess a set of eight prehensile sensory antennae atop their heads.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Trodatomes age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-25 Years | 26-50 Years | 51-100 Years | 101-200 Years | 201-299 Years | 300+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Troda](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Troda), an isolated world on the edge of Hutt Space where the Trodatomes contemplate the mysteries of the universe in secluded monasteries and holy sites.

**Language:** Trodatomes speak their own language of Trodatome, and often learn Huttese or [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary) as a second language. Trodatomes rarely learn to speak Basic.

**Example Names:** Birgid, Fronz, Glaa, Gjork, Kadi, Klaud, Uhe.

**Adventurers:** Trodatome [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigies) and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are common, with The Force serving as an excellent aid for their unusual phisiology. Trodatomes also make for surprisingly adept [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians), however, they tend to work slowly due to their lack of typical appendages.
### Trodatome Species Traits
Trodatomes share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Trodatomes recieve a +2 bonus to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity). Trodatomes are capable scholars and mechanics, but their physiology makes them poorly suited for physical activities.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Trodatomes have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Trodatomes have a base speed of 2 squares.
- **Heightened Awareness:** A Trodatome may choose to reroll any [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Technometry:** Once per encounter a Trodatome can activate the *[Technometry](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technometry)* Force Power, using their [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) modifier in place of a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check.
    - A Trodatome who takes the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-training.md|Force Training]] feat automatically adds a single use of the *[Technometry](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technometry)* Force Power to his or her [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) (for free) instead of this ability.
- **Tinkerer:** A Trodatome can choose to reroll any [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check, but must keep the second result, even if it is worse. In addition, [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) is always a Class Skill for Trodatomes.
- **Unusual Physiology:** A Trodatome's strange physiology makes them poorly compatible with commonplace [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment). A Trodatome suffers a -5 penalty to any attack roll, skill check, or ability check when using [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) not designed for their [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Trodatomes can speak, read, and write Trodatome.
