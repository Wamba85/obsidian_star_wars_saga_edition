*Murachaun Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001 (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

Murachaun are gregarious descendants of herbivores from a temperate, grassy world contacted by scouts in the final days of the Republic. The scouts found a peaceable industrial society spread across a network of cities, towns and farming belts.

The Murachaun demonstrated that they were strong, hardy workers and handy machinists- traits that later caught the eye of the Empire. Thousands of Murachaun were taken off-world and used as slave labor, fanning the flames of rebellion on [Nashu Minor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nashu_Minor). The Murachaun were wise enough to keep their dissent quiet, even as thousands slipped off-world and joined [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance).
