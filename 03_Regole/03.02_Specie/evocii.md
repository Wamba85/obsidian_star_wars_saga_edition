The Evocii are a bipedal, bilateral humanoid Species native to the planet [Evocar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evocar) in the Y'Troub System (now known as [Nal Hutta](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nal_Hutta)). In the great times of the past, they regularly lived to be five hundred years old. Now it is rare to find one more than two hundred years old.

The Evocii were a productive, relatively peaceful race dispersed across the surface of [Evocar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evocar) in clans. They were capable of interstellar contact and built a number of small trading posts across the planet, but [Evocar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evocar) was still considered a quiet, backwater world until the arrival of [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics).

The [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) fled the destroyed ecosystem of their home planet, [Varl](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Varl), in great star caravans. They found Y'Troub perfect for resettlement. They negotiated with the Evocii, whittling away their holdings until finally [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) controlled the bulk of the planet. Eventually, the Evocii were relocated to [Nar Shaddaa](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nar_Shaddaa), while [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) worked to make [Nal Hutta](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nal_Hutta) more suitable for [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/hutt.md|Hutt]] life.

On Nar Shaddaa, the Evocii faced terrible persecution. As the moon became a base for smugglers, they fell farther down the social ladder, until finally they were among the lowest of scavengers on the lowest levels. Still organized by clans, the Evocii have been preyed upon by other scavengers, smugglers, and the wild [Vrblthers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vrblthers). [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) who originally brought them to the Smuggler's Moon forgot about them.

### Evocii Characteristics
**Personality:** While largely peaceful, the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/hutt.md|Hutt]] occupation has hardened the hearts of most. The Evocii prefer cunning guerilla attacks and raids against their enemies, hoping to exhaust their motivations. When [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) forcefully separated and integrated various Evocii tribes, only fragments of their culture survived, mostly in the communities that resisted Hutt Rule and vanished into Nal Hutta's swamps.

**Physical Description:** Evocii have narrow faces with square, lanternlike jaws and elliptical eyes. The crowns of their heads are ringed by blunt bumps. Their skin color varies from pale yellow to a deep lemon shade.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Evocii age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-15 Years | 16-99 Years | 100-199 Years | 200-499 Years | 500+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Once known as [Evocar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Evocar), [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) have renamed the world [Nal Hutta](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nal_Hutta). What few Evocii that were not enslaved by the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) have been relocated to [Nar Shaddaa](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nar_Shaddaa), where they now live as persecuted scavengers.

**Languages:** Having little interaction with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), Evocii speak only their language of Evocii. Their enslavement by [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) have also made them fluent in Huttese to better serve their enslavers. 

**Example Names:** Baranj, Enaq, Ganuk, Grov, Jenks.

**Adventurers:** The most honored members Evocii tribes are rarely the chieftains themselves; the Evocii placed higher value on healers, trackers, and those who could predict Evocar's intemperate weather. As such most Evocii hope to become [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigies) or [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) specializing in [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury).
