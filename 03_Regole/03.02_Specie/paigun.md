*Paigun Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001 (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

Paiguns are experts at mathematics and logic, traits that have made their homeworld of [Paigu](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Paigu) a center for innovation for [The Commonality](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Commonality). Their world also boasts some of the most impressive architecture found anywhere in the Vorzyd cluster, with massive towers that hold thousands of people and rise for miles to touch the storm-wracked sky of their homeworld.
### Paigun Characteristics
**Personality:** Paiguns are adroit theorists who spurn violence and shows of emotion, preferring to let others do their fighting for them. Their sagacity and calculated arrogance doesn't always sit well with their neighbours in the Vorzyd Cluster.

**Physical Description:** Paiguns are rail-thin bipeds with thick, warty gray-green skin and shriveled, prune-like faces. Paiguns typically stand between 1.7 and 2.4 meters tall, although males are generally shorter than females.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Paiguns age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-16 Years | 17-44 Years | 45-69 Years | 70-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Paigu](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Paigu), a world ravaged by fierce lightning storms. The Paiguns have learned to tap into electrical storms as a source of power for their great cities.

**Languages:** Paiguns read, write and speak their own language (Paigun) and Basic. Their native tongue boasts a precision few other tongues can match and includes virtually no imagery, metaphors or euphemisms.

**Example Names:** Hydek Ro, Kaithu Oka, Kitak Hu, Orik Supan, Ousak Nin, Vikra Tha.

**Adventurers:** Paiguns lack the adventurous spirit that drives so many other species, but a few recognize the need to discover new ideas and explore what the galaxy has to offer. These more daring Paiguns are usually [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians), although they can take levels in any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class). Paigun Force-users are rare.
