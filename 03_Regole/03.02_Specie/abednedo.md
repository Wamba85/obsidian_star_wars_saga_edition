Abednedo are a sentient Species native to the planet of the same name ([Abednedo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abednedo_(Planet))) in [The Colonies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Colonies) region of the Galaxy. Abednedo are humanoid and mammalian, and their faces feature dangling mouth tendrils and two fleshy nostrils. Abednedos are brown, cream or tan in color.

They were a common sight in the galaxy, and were found in multiple, contrasting professions. Abednedos are strong supporters of both the Rebellion and the New Republic, similar to the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/mon-calamari.md|Mon Calamari]] and the planets of [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Physical Description:** Abednedo have fleshy nose slits and black eyes, which belonged to sockets that protruded from the side of the individual's elongated head. They also possess dangling mouth tendrils, that are remnants of sensory organs which helped their ancestors to navigate underground in the dark. They can grow hair above their eyes and on the side and back of their heads, which could be white, blond or dark in color. Abednedo have arms that terminated in five digits, and legs that ended in three. Abednedos are brown, cream or tan in color.
