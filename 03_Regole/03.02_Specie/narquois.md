*Narquois Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

The Narquois are the sentient descendants of an arboreal, non-sentient species. Hundreds of years before the Cold War between the [First Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_First_Order) and the [Resistance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Resistance), they found themselves at the mercy of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/neimoidian.md|Neimoidians]], a greedy civilization from neighboring [Neimoidia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Neimoidia) who were building up an empire of wealthy "purse-worlds" for themselves. The Neimoidians occupied [Narq](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Narq) and started treating its natives as virtual serfs. Although the Narquois were actually quite clever, their new masters denied their intelligence, forcing them to work only as miners, engine room crewers, and farm laborers.

The servitude of the Narquois only ended several centuries later, when the authoritarian [Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) was defeated in the Galactic Civil War and was replaced by a much more democratic and egalitarian [New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic). Taking advantage of the regime change, the people of Narq sued the Neimoidians in the New Republic courts, seeking unprecedented levels of compensation for how their species had been treated in the past.
