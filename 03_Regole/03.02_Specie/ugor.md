*Ugor Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The adaptability of Ugors has served them well, for the wealth of their world was a mixed blessing. After developing technology at an early stage in their philosophical evolution, they shortsightedly turned their home into a seething mass of poisonous by-products and overpopulation. Because of their inherent ability to alter themselves to fit new environments, the Ugors, instead of dying with their world, adapted into forms that could live by using toxic garbage and filth as nourishment.
Shortly afterward, the Ugors began worshiping rubbish, and began collecting it from throughout the galaxy, turning their whole system into a galactic dump. The Ugors currently have a competing contract to clean up after Imperial fleets, which always jettison their waste before entering Hyperspace- they are actively competing with the [Squibs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Squibs) for these "Valuable" resources.

The Ugors rose to the top of their profession through shrewd manipulation and outrageous religious claims until much of the galaxy began to depend on the Ugor collection ships to gather and store refuse. Eventually, in a shrewd financial move, the opportunistic Ugors opened up their system spanning junkyard to any and all "Pilgrims" who wish to "Extract Holy Relics" from the condrous system of Paradise. Naturally, a substantial "Donation" is required to enter the system, and all "Holy Relics" must be paid for in full before pilgrims may depart.

### Ugor Characteristics
**Personality:** Ugors believe that gambling, bargaining, and cheating are a way of life. They are an unfriendly, isolated lot who hate everything that is not garbage. Everything, that is, except for food. As with [Ortolans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ortolans), edible items can greatly can greatly influence the opinion of an Ugor, although in no way will it make the Ugor a pleasant companion.

**Physical Description:** Ugors are large, unicellular protozoans with a radius of approximately one meter. They can extrude up to 30 pseudopodia at one time, several of which may contain openings and membranes appropriate for communication, and normally move by oozing from one place to another.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ugors age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-6 Years | 7-13 Years | 14-34 Years | 35-49 Years | 50-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Ugors evolved on an unknown planet in the Paradise System. Though little is known of their homeworld, it must truly have been an idyllic world for the Ugors. A single-celled protozoan, like this Species, would not have evolved to the Ugors' immense size without an easily available source of nourishment and very few predators.

**Language:** Ugors communicate an a gargling language with a simplistic written form.

**Example Names:** ArrGack, GrrKack, HarrGick, SplrMuck.

**Adventurers:** Ugors are ubiquitous in the galaxy, despite the disdain with which other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) treat them. They are, however, rarely found on the surface of a planet, preferring to stay in orbit and have any planetary debris delivered to them (Although they will make exceptions for planets without space travel capabilities).
