Highly intelligent, hermaphroditic insectoids, the Vratix are the creators of the healing substance known as bacta. The Vratix have used bacta for thousands of years, and since the solution includes chemical fluids exuded by the Vratix themselves, they have never been afraid to share the secrets of bacta production with the rest of the galaxy. A healthy business evolved during the time of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) once the galaxy at large realized the healing potential of the miracle substance**.**The Vratix share their homeworld with [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) who used cartels to control bacta production. Emperor Palpatine chose two cartels, the Zaltin and Xucphra factions, to supply the Empire's bacta, effectively eliminating all competition in the bacta market. Competition between the cartels was harsh, and the Vratix, who were often caught in the middle, fought for reform. Some Vratix resorted to terrorism and sabotage to achieve their agenda, fighting with ruthless desperation and no remorse. With the help of [Rogue Squadron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_Squadron), the Vratix eventually liberated their homeworld from the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] cartels and petitioned [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) for admission as a member race. During [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era), the Verachen caste of Vratix controls bacta production, supplying the galaxy's needs during the invasion of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]].

Although they deal frequently with offworlders, the Vratix believe that sights and sounds are unreliable and prefer to touch other beings in order to recognize their presence. This custom does not sit well with many of the [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) they encounter. The custom of referring to themselves in the plural, and by their hive name, stems from the Species' hivelike intelligence; for example, a Vratix might say: "We are pleased to meet you. Our name is Akarin."

### Vratix Characteristics
**Personality:** Practical and analytical, Vratix have trouble understanding art, music, and other forms of creative expression. They act cautious, never rushing into situations without due consideration of the consequences, Because of their knowledge of bacta, Vratix are natural healers, However, most lack the compassion to view the healing process as anything more than a biological exercice.

**Physical Description:** A Vratix has large compound eyes, a stalklike neck, and six limbs sprouting from a cylindrical thorax and abdomen. Two triple-jointed arms extend from the shoulders, ending in long, three-fingered hands. Vratix stand upright on four legs. The rearmost pair are well muscled and used for jumping. Their triangular heads sport two floppy antennae. Small, thin hairs cover a Vratix's body and exude a chemical that changes the color of the skin as an expression of emotion. Vratix average 1.8 to 2.3 meters tall. Most are greenish gray, though their carapaces usually darken with age

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Vratix age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-19 Years | 20-79 Years | 80-139 Years | 140-174 Years | 175+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Thyferra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thyferra), a temperate world with two moons located in [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim). Most Vratix live in modest rain-forest villages consisting of high towers with circular tenaces and arching bridges connecting them.

**Languages:** Vratix speak their own high-pitched language, which is punctuated with clicking sounds and skin color changes. Other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) can learn to understand the Vratix language but cannot speak it. Since the Vratix trade extensively with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), many Vratix learn to speak Basic as well.

**Example Names:** All Vratix have two names. The first is their hive name, the second a given name. Examples include Akarin Xercr, Akarin Ricaev, Qlaeren Hlrf, Qlaeren Rhirr, Toqor Reen, and Toqor lrfwix.

**Adventurers:** Vratix adventurers are usually [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) who earn their keep as engineers or medics, although members of the Species are not restricted from any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class).
