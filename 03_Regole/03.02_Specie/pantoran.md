These blue-skinned [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) come from a cold climate and were vibrant participants in galactic society during the time of the Republic. In the time of the Galactic Civil War, the democratic and politically active Pantorans have found themselves in a precarious position in galactic politics, one rife with disaster but also promise.

Fiercely independent believers in freedom and democracy, Pantorans still have small cultural holdovers from a more feudal era. Pantorans wear yellow marks on their foreheads, under their eyes, and on their cheeks to denote their family names and lineages. Most Pantorans have a general interest in genealogy and history, and enjoy spending time searching for long-lost relatives and connections to ancient heroes and historical figures. A few Pantorans still hold noble titles. Some also wear headgear and jewelry proudly denoting birthplaces and associated famous geographic regions where ancient Pantoran battles, treaties, artistic works, and the like occurred. However, in this current age, Pantorans have turned global politics and debate into an art form in the spirit of democracy.

Bitter and heated arguments rage across Pantoran society regarding the fate of their homeworld. When [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) fell and [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) ascended, Pantorans became deeply uncertain about their relationship with the galaxy. In both their Democratic Assembly and public squares, three different camps have formed regarding Pantora's political future. One camp- the appeasers- considers integration with the Empire a pragmatic goal. With the Empire's recognition, [Pantora](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora) would gain security both militarily and economically. Another camp insists on maintaining the ideals of the Republic. These traditionalists, or republicans, consider the Empire a betrayer of those ideals, although many also believe that the Rebels cannot truly restore the Republic. A growing few believe that [Pantora](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora) needs to strike out on its own, to found new colonies and exploit new resources. These expansionists believe that they need to forge treaties with the nearby slavers and spice traders, but enough Pantorans see that direction as abhorrent that any such bill dies on the Assembly floor.

### Pantoran Characteristics
**Personality:** As members of a society struggling with galactic isolation for the last two decades, Pantorans are open to new ideas, both good and bad. Their homeworld is flush with new philosophies and schools of thought; some foreign, others native, but all changing to match the Pantoran character.

**Physical Description:** Pantorans are a [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) Species with skin of various shades of blue and yellow eyes, with some rare instances of black. Their hair ranges in color from black and blue to light purple and white. They have an average height similar to that of [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), a bit less than two meters. Their physiology allows them to be comfortable in lower temperatures, requiring only a couple layers of casual clothing in icy climates. In all other aspects, Pantorans are nearly identical to [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Pantorans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-16 Years | 17-44 Years | 45-64 Years | 65-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The far Outer Rim world of [Pantora](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantora), a moon of the ice world [Orto Plutonia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Orto_Plutonia), is located halfway between [Suarbi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Suarbi) and [Alzoc](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alzoc) in the Sujimis Sector. Surrounded by slavers and spice traders, Pantorans consider themselves the last holdover of the Republic, complete with a Democratic Assembly.

**Languages:** Another visage of Pantoran feudal culture is found in the various dialects of its language. Each dialect is distinct enough that communication, though possible, is difficult. For this reason, when the Pantorans originally joined the Galactic Senate, they adopted Basic as their official global language.

**Example Names:** Arend Shen, Lassa Rhayme, Notluwiski Papanoida, Riyo Chuchi, Venlana Sipal.

**Adventurers:** Pantorans' devotion to Pantora's future makes them highly motivated in unearthing Republic-era knowledge and technologies. Typical Pantorans act as [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and occasionally [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), although some younger Pantorans view the old Jedi as having a mythical quality, inspiring the Force-sensitive to become [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).
