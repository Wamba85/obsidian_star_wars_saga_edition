*Svivreni Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001 (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

The Svivreni are a well-regarded equinoid species known for their work in the mining and metallurgic industries. Though officially nonaligned during the [Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire)'s reign, many individual Svivreni have assisted the [Rebellion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance), and later the [New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) and the [Galactic Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Alliance). Most work in the private sector.
### Svivreni Characteristics
**Personality:** If asked to sum up the Svivreni in one word, a being would be hard-pressed to offer anything other than "stubborn". Svivreni are nearly impossible to sway once they have made a decision. This trait bodes double for the Imperial forces under the command of [Grand Admiral Thrawn](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Admiral_Thrawn) who - approximately five years after the Battle of Endor - attempt to move on the Svivreni homeworld and are met with stiff resistance.

**Physical Description:** Though short (usually less than a meter tall), Svivreni are heavily muscled and exceptionally resilient. Svivreni posess four-digited hands and cloven hooves, as well as thick heads with broad snouts, large ears and prick ears. Their bodies are almost completely covered in thick hair. Svivreni custom dictates that adults do not cut their hair - long hair among their kind is believed to be an indication of intelligence and fertility (older Svivreni males often have hair below their waists). Svivreni tradiditonally wear sleeveless tunics and work trousers that are covered with pouches and pockets for carrying the various tools used in a day's labor.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Svivreni age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-17 Years | 18-55 Years | 56-89 Years | 90-124 Years | 125+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Svivren](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Svivren), a dangerous, mountain-studded [Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim) world not far from [Andalasa](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Andalasa). Imperial forces moved on Svivren during the Thrawn Crisis but were repelled. Svivren is known for its harsh laws: weapons are not allowed on-world, except for those carried by heavily-armed security troops. Violence on Svivren results in the immediate execution of the perpetrator. These Svivreni codes are criticised by groups throughout the galaxy, but crime on Svivren does remain low. Smugglers and other such scoundrels and rogues generally avoid the world.

**Languages:** Svivreni speak and read Svivreni, the vocal range for which most species (including humans) cannot emulate. 

**Example Names:** Kitalic Nirasic, Mihalik, Casin Mak.

**Adventurers:** Most Svivreni encountered in the galaxy at large will either be [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or experts in the fields of metallurgy or geology, hired specifically to oversee mining projects. Some Svivreni [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) [[03_Regole/03.04_Talenti/jedi-consular-talent-tree.md|Consulars]] are known to ply the [Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) and [Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions).
