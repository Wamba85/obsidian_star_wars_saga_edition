*T'surr Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The galaxy has seen very little of the T'surr Species, and thankfully so. lts most infamous representative is the notorious pirate and slave trader, Krayn, who not only plundered ships but also sold the captive crew into slavery. T'surr are among the galaxy's most dangerous predators, although their relative scarcity makes them seem less threatening. Although their level of technology does not meet the galactic standard, T'surr capably use technology scavenged from the ships of their victims.

T'surr are not represented on the Galactic Senate during the [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) or [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) because they are widely regarded as nothing more than dangerous, marauding killers. The harsh living conditions on the T'surr homeworld have created a Species of survivors who care little for others. The wealth of a T'surr is rated by the number and quality of slaves they own. A T'surr without slaves is worth as much as a freighter captain without a Starship.

Female Tsurr are never seen- males indicate that they are small feeble creatures that never leave the safety of the home.

### T'surr Characteristics
**Personality:** T'surr males are violent, avaricious predators who treat weaker species as chattel. They use their brute strength and ruthless cunning to rule their T'surr and non-T'surr subordinates, eliminating potential rivals. They like to keep trophies as reminders of their conquests, often wearing these stolen trinkets on their belts. Whereas T'surr males rule the stars, T'surr females rule the homes. For this reason, T'surr males anxiously leave their homeworld, leaving their mates to raise the children.

**Physical Description:** Hulking brutes, T'surr males stand between 2.3 and 2.6 meters tall. They are strong and solidly built, with blue skin that has the sheen of marble. Their huge heads sport numerous horns, large, sensitive ears, a mouth filled with razor sharp teeth and four gleaming red eyes. T'surr females are physically smaller and leaner than the males, standing about 2 meters tall. They also lack the mane of horns that contributes to the males fierce appearance.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** T'surr age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-15 Years | 16-45 Years | 46-75 Years | 76-99 Years | 100+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [T'surr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/T'surr_(Planet)), a cold and windblown desert planet located in [The Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region). A distant and feeble sun provides little light, and other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) find the planet's high gravity daunting and oppressive.

**Languages:** T'surr speak and read T'surrese. They also speak Basic with ease.

**Example Names:** Datynask, Dyrago, Feyrr, Jeneyd, Krayn, Reythan, Shyntak, Treykon.

**Adventurers:** A solitary T'surr will often join forces with a powerful band of pirates, privateers. or smugglers. These rare T'surr don't automatically regard all other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) as their lesser, but they are still drawn to violent, predatory professions. T'surr [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are common, and the galaxy has yet to face a T'surr Force-user.
