*Zilkin Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty.*

The Zilkins are a tiny, amphibious Species with sharp intellects and stubborn attitudes. Their short lifespans cause Zilkins to be one of the fastest learners in the galaxy, capable of learning in weeks what takes other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) months. However, their short statures causes many Zilkins to develop inferiority complexes, which in turn creates more blusterful boasting. This boasting leads to a poor reputation among other, which heightens the Zilkin's inferiority, creating a horrific cycle of depression.

Due to this cycle, Zilkins hold mentaps and other psychiatrists to an unusually high level of respect, and they truly treasure those friends that they do make. Zilkins' sharp minds and learning ability makes them capable slicers and computer specialists. Many often join governmental militaries, becoming well-known for their tactical prowess.
