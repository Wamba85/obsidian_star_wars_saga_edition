Widely recognized as a slave species of the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts), the Nikto have served their masters since before the founding of [The Old Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic), proving to be cunning warriors in the Hutts' battle with the legendary conqueror Xim the Despot. Wherever the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) are, the Nikto are never far behind. Because of their homeworld's radioactive atmosphere, the Nikto have five distinct subspecies, each adapted to a specific type of terrain (see [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/nikto-survival.md|Nikto Survival]] feat).

### Nikto Characteristics

**Personality:** Although lacking in personal charisma, Nikto posses a single-minded tenacity that makes them excellent followers. Eons of enslavement by the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) have left them more comfortable with taking orders from their masters than with thinking on their feet.

**Physical Description:** Tough, leathery skin and a lack of extensive facial muscles limit the range of Nikto facial expression.  Their deep black eyes further enhance their reptilian appearance. A Nikto's subspecies can be determined by his or her skin tone and the presence of small spikes or horns. 

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Nikto stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs 60 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Nikto age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-15 Years | 16-35 Years | 36-54 Years | 55-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Kintan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kintan), a radioactive planet located within Hutt Space in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** All Nikto learn to read, speak, and write their own Nikto language along with either Basic or Huttese.

**Example Names:** Bok, Fi-Ek Sirch, Giran, Klaatu, Ma'kis'shaalas, Nysad, Wooof.

**Adventurers:** Nikto have the tenacity to pursue any career, but their status as a slave species to the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) forces them into roles as guards and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers).

### Nikto Species Traits
Nikto share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Nikto receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Nikto are tough and hardened, but their subservient status stunts their willpower and creativity.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Nikto have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Nikto have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Great Fortitude:** Nikto gain a +2 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), having evolved to survive the harsh environment of their homeworld.
- **Natural Armor:** A Nikto's tough hide provides a +2 Natural Armor bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). A Natural Armor bonus stacks with an Armor bonus.
- **Survival Instinct:** A Nikto can choose to reroll any [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Nikto can speak, read, and write Nikto, as well as either Basic or Huttese (chosen at [Character Creation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Creation)).
