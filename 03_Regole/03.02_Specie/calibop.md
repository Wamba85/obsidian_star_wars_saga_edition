*Calibop Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Aliens Stats counterpart).*

Calibops are a colorful avian Species with massive wings ending in prehensile feathers, hailing from the planet [Cali](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cali). Mostly humanoid in build, Calibops have a bushy mane and tail, appearing to be a cross between some sort of feline and bird. A Calibop's wings are very powerful, and allow normal avian flight as opposed to simple gliding, something rarely found in sentient species of their size and build.

Calibops are excellent diplomats, and are often skilled negotiators and heavily involved in politics. Derision directed at Calibops often calls them cowardly, as they will almost always seek nonviolent solutions to any problems. Unlike most other nonviolent [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), Calibops can become very flustered, and have been known to have outbursts of emotion when frustrated. Their manes puff up and their tails lash from side to side when agitated, and though they seem to be in control of their emotions, they are as easily provoked as any other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
