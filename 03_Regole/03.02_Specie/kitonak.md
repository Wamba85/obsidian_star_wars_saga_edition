*Kitonak Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Kitonak are simple, primitive beings who have developed no technology beyond the most basic tools and have no written language. On their homeworld, they are organized into small tribes that survive by hunting migrating herds of [Chooba](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chooba).

The Kitonak society's most advanced achievement is music, which plays a central role in their culture. Young Kitonak are educated through epic songs that pass knowledge from generation to generation.

Kitonak who are encountered off their homeworld are usually freed slaves. When the Species' homeworld was first discovered by scouts a few decades prior to the rise of the Empire, a number of enterprising slave traders thought the Kitonak's unique musical performances would make them interesting additions to the households of wealthy crime lords and shady senators. However, the unwillingness of the Kitonak to adhere to anyone's pace but their own (Even in the face of threats of violence and death) led to their execution, abandonment, or release. Some masters attempted to recoup the purchase price of their useless slaves by making the Kitonak pay for their freedom. Most of these Kitonak found work as musicians, and the merging of galactic popular music and the music of Kitonak society led to the rise of several innovative music styles during the turbulent Rebellion Era.

A number of Kitonak were recruited as spies for [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) during the Galactic Civil War. Their Species are almost tailor-made for the job: they come from a tradition of oral histories, so they have sharp memories, they do not get bored just observing and waiting for something to happen, and most non-Kitonak have a hard time telling whether a Kitonak is awake or asleep.

### Kitonak Characteristics
**Personality:** Kitonak are beings of exceptional patience. They do everything with slow deliberation, including breathing and eating. Every decision is weighed with great care, even if it's something as trivial as which one of two seemingly identical packages of dried rations to purchase. They are so methodical and slow moving that many other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) become annoyed with them and attempt to rush them. When others try to rush them, Kitonak slow down even more out of protest.

Kitonak have a well-deserved reputation for being insanely brave, once they get around to confronting danger. They are very steadfast in the face of any opposition. The only things they are truly afraid of are quicksand and caves- quicksand because it represents a slow and painful death for a Kitonak who only has to breathe every few hours, and caves because Kitonak legends claim they are gateways to the Realm of the Dead.

**Physical Description:** Kitonak are humanoids with sturdy legs and thick arms that end in pudgy fingers. Their eyes, ears, mouth, and other bodily orifices are all nearly invisible within the folds of their tough, leathery hides. Kitonak possess an extra set of lungs that enables them to store oxygen for up to 4 hours. Adult Kitonak stand 1 to 1.5 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Kitonak age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 Years | 6-10 Years | 11-60 Years | 61-100 Years | 101-120 Years | 121+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Kirdo III](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kirdo_III), an arid planet in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). Winds ship sand clouds across the planet's surface at speeds that often exceed 400 kilometers per hour.

**Languages:** Kitonak speak Kitonese and can learn to speak Basic with ease, albeit slowly. They know that other beings become irritated when they speak with them, so most Kitonak only speak to non-Kitonak when addressed directly or when they feel they have something important to say.

**Example Names:** Anarin, Enkor, Gorlak, Nert, Norzek, Rufar, Runk, Snit, Terno, Werg.

**Adventurers:** Kitonak adventurers are usually [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). Before the Jedi Purge, more than one Jedi Master wondered whether members of the Species would be suitable for training as [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi); however, no record of any Jedi Master training one exists. Kitonak Force-users are usually [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigies) who spend most of their time in deep meditation.
