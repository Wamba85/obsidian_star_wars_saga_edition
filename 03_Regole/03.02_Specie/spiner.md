*Spiner Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Humanoid Species with the ability to shoot quills from their backs and arms at opponents, the Spiners have been driven into virtual extinction by natural disaster and their own violent tendencies. Spiners evolved on a world hidden deep within the stellar cloud drifts of the Elrood Sector. Their homeworld exploded when its star went supernova roughly 200 years before the rise of the Empire. Republic scientists discovered the imminent disaster in progress but could not rescue more than a few thousand individuals. These Spiners were quickly absorbed into galactic society. Little of their own culture survived. Since their traditions were mostly incompatible with the alien societies they settled near or within, and Spiner technology (with the exception of certain geothermal energy management techniques) had been well below galactic standard.

It is widely believed that the surviving population of Spiners is too small for the Species to avoid extinction. The future of the Species is further endangered by the little-known fact that a genetic flaw prevents Spiners from reproducing anywhere other than in the Elrood Sector. However, interested historians have pointed out that some "lost" Spiner colonies may exist within the Elrood Sector. Records of their existence may have been lost with the destruction of their homeworld and the rise of the Empire.
### Spiner Characteristics
**Personality:** Spiners are laconic beings who generally keep their thoughts to themselves. Although loyal to their friends and honorable in their dealings, they often come across to strangers as terse, reserved, and introverted.

**Physical Description:** Spiners are muscular beings covered in soft brown fur. Their faces feature a short snout and deep-set, small black eyes. Their backs are covered with rigid spines that they can raise or lower by tightening their upper body muscles. Further, Spiners with the appropriate martial training can fire their spines as ranged weapons in combat. Males and females are roughly identical in build, with both genders standing between 1.6 and 2.2 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Spiners age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-17 Years | 18-55 Years | 56-74 Years | 75-85 Years | 86+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Worxer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Worxer), located in [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories). [Worxer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Worxer) is destroyed 200 years before the rise of the Empire.

**Languages:** The Spiners' ancient language, Worxi, became lost to them after the destruction of their homeworld, and they adopted Basic as their "native" tongue.

**Example Names:** Briss, Devik, Fifter, Firril, Hedji, Jerrid, Meejen, Prikler, Toira, Yaff.

**Adventurers:** Spiner adventurers can belong to any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class) and frequently [Multiclass](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Multiclass). [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are the most common [Heroic Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes).
### Spiner Species Traits
Spiners share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Spiners receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Spiners are agile and flexible, but they are seen as introverted and terse by other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Spiners have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Spiners have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bonus Feat:** All Spiners gain the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/improved-damage-threshold.md|Improved Damage Threshold]] feat as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) at 1st level.
- **Natural Weapons:** A Spiner has Natural Weapons, in the form of their Quills. When a Spiner makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of Piercing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Spiner are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
    - Additionally, these Quills can be fired a number of squares away equal to the Spiner's [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) (for example, a 4th level Spiner [Soldier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier) with a [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) of +4 could fire their Quills up to 4 squares away). When used in this way, a Spiner does not add their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) bonus to the attack and damage rolls.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Spiner can speak, read, and write Basic. Worxi- their true native language- has become extremely rare after the destruction of their homeworld, but those who survived can also speak, read, and write it as well.
