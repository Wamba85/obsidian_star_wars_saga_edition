*Patitite Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*
The Patitites are tiny sentient beings native to the swamps of [Patitite Pattuna](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Patitite_Pattuna). Despite their diminutive stature, they pack enough punch to take down a pair of wandering Droids. Though technologically primitive, they are bright-minded and do have a grasp on machinery. For example, the Patitites carry powered polearms and were able to assist in repairing a downed [Y-Wing Bomber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Y-Wing_Bomber) during the Clone Wars. They are socially primitive, however, living in a tyrannical dictatorship where all Patitites are subservient to their ruler, Hay-Zu. All this changed when R2-D2 and C-3PO inadvertently stumbled upon Patitite society in general, and stumbled upon Hay-Zu quite literally.

With the introduction of democracy by C-3PO, the Patitites fell into civil war, with multiple Patitites claiming leadership. This war would last for several months, ending just before Republic scouts found [Patitite Pattuna](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Patitite_Pattuna) backtracking the Droids' flight plan. The world holds little interest to the Republic, with little strategic value to the Clone Wars, or the Empire, due to its lack of resources. As such, Patitites are a rare sight until late into [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), when a small group of Patities join the growing coalition as a member world.

### Patitite Characteristics
**Personality:** Patitites are inquisitive and quick-tempered, with an intelligence that belies their low technological level. The tyrannical reign of Hay-Zu left a generation leaderless, and the subsequent civil war creates multiple splinter groups to form their own governments. Patitites that leave [Patitite Pattuna](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Patitite_Pattuna) do so to benefit their homeworld, learning what they can to bring home to the next generation.

**Physical Description:** Patitites are diminutive, colorful humanoids with high-pitched voices. Their skin tones can range from light tones of blue or green, to darker shades of purple. They dress in elaborate headdresses, with protrusions extending from the sides. Males dress in green and gray clothing, while females wear more colorful outfits, often matching their own complexions.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Patitites age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0-5 Years | 6-9 Years | 10-21 Years | 22-29 Years | 30-37 Years | 38+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Patitites hail from the primitive world of [Patitite Pattuna](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Patitite_Pattuna), a lush and vibrant world with tall plants and purple ferns. It is one of the many habitable worlds of the Bright Jewel Sector in the outer reaches of [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim).

**Languages:** The Patitites are mysteriously fluent in Basic, suggesting a prior connection to the greater galaxy. If the Patitites ever had a language of their own, it has been lost to history.

**Example Names:** Hay-Zu, Jimba, Tagoo.

**Adventurers:** Patitites are most commonly [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), taking advantage of their small size to stalk their targets stealthily. A number of Patitite [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) have emerged with the advent of democracy, and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are also somewhat common.

### Patitite Species Traits
Patitites share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** None. Patitites lack the extreme specialization of more advanced [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), allowing them to better adapt to several different occupations and mindsets.
- **Diminutive Size:** As Diminutive creatures, Patitites gain a +5 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +15 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are one quarter of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Patitites have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Bonus Trained Skill:** A lack of specialization allows Patitites to hold a broad and diverse skill set. A Patitite character chooses one additional [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) at 1st level. The [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) must be chosen from the character's list of Class Skills.
- **Primitive:** Patitites do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Classes) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Patitites can speak, read, and write Basic.
