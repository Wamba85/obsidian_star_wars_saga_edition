*Chironian Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker.*

The Chironians are an equine-humanoid hybrid Species native to the planet [Chiron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiron); located within [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Outer_Rim_Territories) known as the Ash Worlds, their homeworld still bears remnants of the sacking and bombardment of [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Hutt Kajidics) thousands of years ago. Chironians are distinguished by their centauriform anatomy; while their torso, arms and head resemble those of a humanoid, their lower body is that of a four-legged equine. The Chironians have been largely reclusive from galactic affairs; while incorporated in [The Sith Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith_Empire) during the reign of Revan, [Chiron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiron) was otherwise insulated from most other events.

Some Chironians were influenced by the ideology of [The Diversity Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Diversity_Alliance) following the cruel reign of the Empire, but the majority were content to remain in isolation.

### Chironian Characteristics
**Personality:** Chironians express emotions through the mannerisms of their hooves; when impatient, they stamp them; when excited, they tapp them in a quick dance, or canter in a spot. The centauriforms frequently shake their heads and manes, and when angry, their faces flush a deeper shade.

**Physical Description:** In addition to their equine physiology, Chironians are also notable for the presence of two transparent, smooth horns extending from their foreheads. These horns start as small velvet-covered knobs, which eventually break through as fully-fledged horns. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Chironians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-16 Years | 17-39 Years | 40-54 Years | 55-69 Years | 70+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Chironians hail from [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) planet of [Chiron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiron), in the devastated Ash Worlds Sector.

**Languages:** Chironians possess expressive, husky voices. Most can learn to speak Basic, although some speak with a heavy accent.

**Example Names:** Cinall, Jefin, Lusa, Slaturn, Sinall.

**Adventurers:** Chironians largely keep to themselves on [Chiron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiron) until [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era), when several Chironians were kidnapped by The Empire Reborn, causing some Chironians to leave [Chiron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chiron) in search of their missing people. These Chionians are mostly [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), and some Force-sensitive Chironians go on to become [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) in Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order.
