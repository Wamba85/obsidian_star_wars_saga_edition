*Eodon Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Eodons are a mythical Species amongst [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes); their beautiful tusks are seen as one of the greatest treasures on the Forest Moon, both for the great luck imbued within them and for their versatility in certain branches of [Totem Magic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Totem_Magic). The Eodons themselves hold such mysticism in scorn, such superstitions have brought them nothing but trouble and caused most of their tribes to isolate themselves from outsiders. Needing to hunt down their stolen tusks is an exercise in frustration, frustration the Eodons are more than happy to take out on their surroundings.

### Eodon Characteristics
**Personality:** Eodons can often come off as short-tempered due to constantly needing to drive off tusk thieves. When they can let their guards down, however, they prove to be a hearty people with a dry wit.

**Physical Description:** Eodons are large, blue-gray pachydermoids who tower above other members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes). They have large, flappy ears and beautiful ivory tusks that are held to enormous awe by others.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Eodons age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-13 Years | 14-23 Years | 24-99 Years | 100-179 Years | 180-229 Years | 230+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Eodons live on the outskirts of the great forests of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), splitting their time between there and the flatter plains they can better maneuver in.

**Languages:** Eodon is a throaty language that other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) have difficulty reproducing; most Eodon also learn Old Jinda or Struttese out of necessity to track down their stolen tusks.

**Example Names:** Bilumot, Gebitly, Narulev, Waluvi.

**Adventurers:** Eodon adventurers are usually driven by need rather than want; the constant theft of their tusks pushing many Eodons to either [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) depending on if they prefer force, guile, or deception to retrieve their rightful orientations. Despite their "magical" nature, few Eodon [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) and even fewer Eodon [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) can be found on the Forest Moon.
### Eodon Species Traits
Eodons share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Eodons receive a +2 bonus to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). The constant hunts for their stolen tusks make the Eodons well-traveled, but their frustrations are often taken out against others.
- **Large Size:** As Large creatures, Eodons take a -1 size penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a -5 size penalty on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks, and they gain a +5 size bonus to their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). Their lifting and carrying limits are double those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Eodons have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bonus Feat:** All Eodons receive the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Primitive:** Eodons do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Rage:** Once per day, a Eodon can fly into a Rage as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). While Raging, the Eodon temporarily gains a +2 Rage bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls, but cannot use [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) that require patience and concentration, such as [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics), [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth), or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force). A fit of Rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the Eodon's [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
    - At the end of its Rage, the Eodon moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). The penalties imposed by this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) persist until the Eodon takes at least 10 minutes to recuperate, during which time the Eodon can't engage in any strenuous activity.
- **Stability:** A Eodon's four legs grant them a +5 stability bonus to resist attempts to knock them [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone).
- **Unusual Physiology:** Eodons can use only their single trunk to manipulate their environments. As such, they can never wield weapons of larger size then they are (unless they take the [Wookiee Grip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiee_Grip) feat), cannot hold multiple items or weapons, and never add double their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) bonus (if any) to damage rolls.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Eodons can speak Trekk. They have no written form of their language.
