Sy Myrthians evolved on the tranquil planet of [Sy Myrth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sy_Myrth). They are primarily business-beings that act as salesmen and customer service representatives for the businesses of the galaxy. Their naturally outgoing nature makes them very proficient in dealing with customers. Because their planet has always been so tranquil, they never found the need to adapt against predators. Their thick hide is a result of fatty tissues stored as a protective layer for warmth during their cold season.

The Sy Myrthians get around on a single limb, which is broad enough to be able to slither, shuffle and scoot around slowly. In a pinch, it is also capable coiling and then making great leaps that belie their large bodies. Early in their existence, the Sy Myrthians used this leap to spring on top of unsuspecting prey from large distances away, or to reach at fruit on tall trees common on their homeworld.
