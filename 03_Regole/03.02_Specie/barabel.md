*Reference Book: [Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

A towering reptilian Species, the Barabel are relative newcomers to the galactic community. Having evolved from nocturnal predators, Barabels are well-suited to cope with prolonged period of darkness, and they retain much of their ancestor's ferocity.

Several centuries prior to the formation of the Empire- at least according to Barabel legend- an [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ithorian.md|Ithorian]] Jedi explorer named Noga-ta came to their world and peacefully settled a millennium-long civil war stemming from a dispute over prime hunting grounds. This instills a high regard for the Jedi in all Barabel for centuries to follow, even in the wake of the Galactic Empire's anti-Jedi propaganda. For a short time, the Barabels are hunted by illegal safaris set up by Imperial-backed Planetary Safaris, but a massed uprising by the Barabels compels the Empire to intervene and put a stop to the hunts.

Offworld, Barabels take up professions that make use of their predatory nature, the most common being bounty hunting. Surprisingly, Barabels willingly follow orders once a [Chain of Command](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chain_of_Command) is clearly established, making them prized members of mercenary units. Thy carry out orders efficiently and quickly, but they are not hesitant to challenge a leader if their survival is threatened. Barabels are also frequent and popular participants in the sport of [Shockboxing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shockboxing). The monstrous brute Tull Raine holds [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) title for years, developing a reputation for killing opponents in the ring.

#### **Jedi Respect**

The impact of a lone [Jedi Knight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Knight) on the Barabel culture, centuries before the rise of the Empire, gives the entire [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) a deeply ingrained respect for members of the Jedi order, to such an extent that Barabel accept the word of a Jedi at face value, even when they might otherwise disregard the same statement from a non-Jedi. However, beings who gain a Barabel's trust by falsely claiming to be Jedi quickly learn the folly of their ways when the ruse is exposed.

To this end, characters who have proven themselves to be Jedi are considered to have [Favorable Circumstances](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Favorable_Circumstances) when making [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks against a Barabel.

### Barabel Characteristics
**Personality:** Barabels are ruthlessly pragmatic and independent. They express a wide range of emotions with a simple "Sissing" sound, causing other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to view them as mean spirited, or at least constantly angry. Barabels' aggressive nature and predatory instincts frequently lead them to solve problems with the direct approach, and they have no qualms about killing.

**Physical Description:** Barabels are towering bipeds with reptilian features: a prominent jaw; sharp teeth; a long tail; and remarkably tough, dark scales. Barabels are between 1.9 and 2.3 meters in height, adding to their fearsome reputation.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Barabel stands at 2.0 meters tall and weighs 110 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Barabels age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-15 Years | 16-40 Years | 41-59 Years | 60-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Barabels hail from [Barab I](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Barab_I), a dark and murky planet located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** Barabels speak Barabel, an expressive language consisting primarily of "sissing," with short words expressing entire ideas and conversations.

**Example Names:** Baraduk, Ragath, Saba, Shaka-ka, Tesar, Tibor, Vangar.

**Adventurers:** Few Barabels choose to leave their homeworld, but those who do usually become bounty hunters and trackers. Others are recruited into mercenary companies, and several [Shockboxing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shockboxing) promoters feature Barabels in their stables.

### Barabel Species Traits
Barabels share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Barabels receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Barabels are tough and physically gifted, but lack grace and tend to be rather gullible.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Barabels have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Barabels have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Darkvision:** Barabels ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (including [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness. However, they cannot perceive colors in total darkness.
- **Intimidating Presence:** A Barabel may choose to reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) others, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Natural Armor:** A Barabel's thick scaly hide provides a +2 Natural Armor bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). A Natural Armor bonus stacks with an Armor Bonus.
- **Natural Weapons:** A Barabel has Natural Weapons in the form of sharp claws, needle-sharp teeth, and a thick tail. When making an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, a Barabel can choose to use Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage (Claws), piercing damage (Bite), or bludgeoning damage (Tail) with that attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Barabels are always considered armed when attacking with their Natural Weapons.
- **Primitive:** Barabels do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Radiation Resistance:** A Barabel's armored hide protects them from hazardous [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation), granting the Barabel a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) to resist the effects of [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation). In addition, Barabels never gain a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) from the effects of [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation).
- **Stun Resistance:** A Barabel's reflective scales defuse the effects of [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) weapons, granting them a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) to resist the effects of [Stun Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Damage).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Barabels can speak, read, and write Barabel.
