*Noheon Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Noehons are diminutive arboreal insectoids prone to infightings. Instead of a unified government, they live in isolated communities called Welds. A Noehon Weld can have anywhere from a few hundred to up to 10,000 members. A dominant male Noehon rules the weld by driving off adolescent male Noehons when they "Come of Age" and trading superfluous adolescent females to other welds for valued goods, technology, or precious baubles. A few Welds will steal another's adolescent females instead of trading for them, particularly if the Weld is small, poorly defended, or otherwise vulnerable.

Visiting spacefaring merchants introduced blasters and vibro weapons to the industrialized Noehon culture, turning tribal rivalries into all-out "Weld Wars" that continue until one side is annihilated. Although the Noehons never developed space flight, their planet receives plenty of visitors who are more than happy to transport Noehons offworld for a "Fair Price" which has enabled the highly adaptive Species to colonize other worlds across the galaxy.

When the dominant male of a weld grows too feeble to rule by force, a younger male rival kills him and usurps control of the weld. Most visitors know better than to stand between an ambitious Noehon and his "Destiny.”

### Noehon Characteristics** **
**Personality:** Male and female Noehons raised in a Weld are usually abusive and combative. They sheepishly placate their superiors and are unnecessarily cruel to their inferiors and underlings. Noehon raised outside a Weld are more even-tempered and better equipped to function socially within the greater galactic community. Noehons are fastidious and orderly beings. They use every resource at their disposal and never discard something that might be useful later.

**Physical Description:** Noehons resemble bipedal insects with enormous multifaceted eyes, large mandibles, four arms, and a soft carapace covered in short bristles. The average Noehon stands about 1.1 meters tall. Glands on either side of their mouths produce a musky secretion used to mark territory, possessions, and even subordinates. Every Noehon exudes a distinctive musk.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Noehons age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 Years | 3-4 Years | 5-24 Years | 25-37 Years | 38-44 Years | 45+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Noe'ha'on](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noe'ha'on), a jungle world located in [The Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region).

**Languages:** Spoken Noehonese incorporates scent with mandible clicks and shrill sounds. The Noehons have no written language. Noehons have trouble speaking other languages but deal with enough offworlders to make learning Basic worthwhile.

**Example Names:** Gi'kha, Hark'r, Ki'nakra, Ri'zat, Tir'uh, Zak'r. 

**Adventurers:** Most Noehons encountered in galactic society are slaves, descendants of slaves, or slavers. They gravitate toward practices that reinforce a strict hierarchy, such as law, accounting, and organized crime. Noehon heroes can belong to any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class), although no Noehon to date has been to to be Force-sensitive.

### Noehon Species Traits
Noehons share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Noehons receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Noehons are flexible and quick, but are bull-headed and unnecessarily cruel.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Noehons gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Combat) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Noehons have a base speed of 4 squares. They also have a climb speed of 2 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Noehon gains the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dual-weapon-mastery-i.md|Dual Weapon Mastery I]] Feat as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) provided he or she meets the prerequisites of the [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) (Minimum [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) of 13 and [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) of +1).
- **Expressive Pheromones:** Noehons can use their musk to communicate amongst themselves. This form of communication has a maximum range of 20 squares.
    - [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) with the Scent Species Trait can detect Noehon pheromones by smell, but this does not allow them to understand what the Noehons are communicating.
- **Extra Arms:** Noehons can hold up to four items or Weapons at a time. This ability does not grant extra attacks; however, it does mean a Noehon can wield two two-handed weapons at a time.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Noheon can speak Noehonese. They have no written form of their language.
