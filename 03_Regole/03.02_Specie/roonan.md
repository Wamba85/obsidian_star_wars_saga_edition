*Roonan Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Roonans are an influential Species within [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic), with many notable politicians and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) among their numbers. Despite this, Roonans have maintained a degree of xenophobia, even after many thousands of years of active participation in galactic society, making them the perfect pawns in Darth Sidious' grand scheme.
### Roonan Characteristics
**Personality:** Roonans would be considered perfectionists by the standards of most [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). They are highly particular, and see the slightest mistake as a deep insult. Perhaps as a result of this, they are also somewhat xenophobic, preferring to deal with their own kind.

**Physical Description:** Roonans are short, bipedal humanoids with blue, almond-shaped eyes. They have two wide hands with five digits each. They have fairly large, oval heads with small ears and tiny teeth. Their wrinkled skin can be green, gray, or blue.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Roonans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-13 Years | 14-18 Years | 19-54 Years | 55-79 Years | 80-109 Years | 110+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Roona](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Roona), a highly ordered world of perfectly-cultivated gardens and ambitious architectural designs spanning entire cities.

**Languages:** Roonans speak their own language of Roonak and Basic.

**Example Names:** Aang, Edcel Bar Gane, Halsey, Jayfo Ong, Lev'loa, Seles, Tukker Val Loo.

**Adventurers:** Roonan adventurers are often driven to succeed as [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) due to their natural perfectionism and their high degree of influence in the Republic.
### Roonan Species Traits
Roonans share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Roonans receive a +2 bonus to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Roonans are influential, but also frail and somewhat narrow-minded.

Roonans gain a +2 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to improve their [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) by any creature of a different [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
