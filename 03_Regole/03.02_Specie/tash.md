*Tash Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty.*

The Hepsalum Tash, or "The Tash" as they are collectively known, are a Species of forest giants indigenous to the Dagobah System. Adults can grow to heights of eight meters or more. Tough, leathery skin hangs in folds around their thick limbs, and its coloration varies from pale yellow ochre to deep sienna red-brown. Tiger-stripe marks and spotting indicate both age and sex. A long flexible neck ending in a broad, flat, whiskered face gives the head and neck a curious wormlike appearance. The claw-like right hand is used to forage for roots and ground nuts, important elements of their vegetarian diet.

The Tash are a simple, peace-loving race, and the impenetrable thicket of Dagobah's surface ideally suits their reclusive nature. Although cumbersome in appearance, the Tash are skilled craftsman of utensils, clothing, and musical instruments. The Tash enjoy nothing more than a story, a song, and a good pipe.
### Tash Characteristics

Tash share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Tash receive a +2 bonus to both their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). Tash are agile in mind and remarkable dexterous, but their physical strength is lacking.

Their lifting and carrying limits are double those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Tash have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Natural Armor:** A Tash's thick skin provides a +1 Natural Armor bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). A Natural Armor bonus stacks with an Armor bonus.
- **Pacifism:** As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a Tash can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of a single target within line of sight.

    - The target must be able to hear and understand the Tash for this ability to have any effect, and any single target can be affected only once at any given time (meaning that multiple Tash may not use this ability on the same target at the same time). This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
