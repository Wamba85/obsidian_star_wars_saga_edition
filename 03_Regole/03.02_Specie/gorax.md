*Gorax Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

As brave as the native [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) are, the thundering ground-shaking presence of a Gorax giant is enough to frighten even the greatest warrior. Thankfully, these immense humanoids are rare, with only a scant few being spotted in the forests of the verdant moon.

Goraxes stand well over six meters in height, though there have been records of truly immense giants of even greater heights. Their bodies are covered with thick, matted black-brown fur. Their hairless faces have protruding lower jaws filled with pointed teeth. Sensitive pointed ears compensate for their small, weak eyes; bright light is painful to Goraxes, so they prefer to hunt at night. Goraxes have only recently developed sentience, and are quite primitive; they wear crudely stitched-together clothing, and use simple weapons and tools like clubs and staves. Goraxes have been known to domesticate pets, such as [Boar-Wolves](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Boar-Wolves), but appear to be solitary beings.

### Gorax Characteristics
**Personality:** Powerful but primitive, Goraxes are solitary creatures. Their limited sentience and reclusive lifestyle makes them a rare and dangerous sight to [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes).

**Physical Description:** Humanoid in appearance, Goraxes are covered in thick, matted fur of wither black, brown, or gray colorization. Their hairless faces are dominated by protruding lower jaws and heavy brows with wide, long, and pointed ears highly sensitive to noises made by small animals. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Goraxes age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-20 Years | 21-50 Years | 51-170 Years | 171-230 Years | 231-290 Years | 291+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor); Goraxes live in solitude, taking residence in the world's many mountains and leaving only to raid the local villages or to seek a mate.

**Languages:** Goraxes communicate through grumbling noises, their deep voices unable to be replicated by most other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**Example Names:** Caeshi, Heupha, Salma, Teegho.

**Adventurers:** When remaining on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), Goraxes raid [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ewok.md|Ewok]] villages, smashing through walls as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). Goraxes take [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) both for food and kept in hanging cages as pets. The few Goraxes taken (unwillingly) from their homeworld are resentful gladiators and personal pets of crime lords, their spite kept only in check by hatred of their owners.
### Gorax Species Traits
Goraxes share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Goraxes receive a +2 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -4 penalty to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence). Goraxes are only just achieving sentience, but they can be deceptively crafty and have a keen sense of hearing.
- **Huge Size:** As Huge creatures, Goraxes take a -2 size penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a -10 size penalty on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks, and they gain a +10 size bonus to their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). Their lifting and carrying limits are quadruple those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Goraxes have a base speed of 8 squares.
- **Bonus Trained Skill:** A Gorax's solitude gives them significant time to pursue their own interests. A Gorax character chooses one additional [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) at 1st level. The [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) must be chosen from the character's list of Class Skills.
- **Light Sensitivity:** When exiting an area of shadowy illumination into an undarkened area, all creatures have [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) from Goraxes for a number of rounds equal to 5 - the Gorax's [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (minimum 1 round).
- **Low-Light Vision:** Goraxes ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (but not [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness.
- **Primitive:** Goraxes do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Goraxes can speak Gorax. They have no written form of their language.
