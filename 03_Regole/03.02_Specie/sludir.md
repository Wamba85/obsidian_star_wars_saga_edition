*Sludir Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The fierce Sludir evolved from a primitive tribal society to an intricate feudal caste society or rulers, warriors, artisans, and workers. In addition to learning the traditions and ways of their particular caste-clans, Sludir children were taught to respect the code of battle. Combat became the true test of a Sludir's character. Hiding and retreating were the tactics of a coward; a Sludir who resorted to such tactics would not only dishonor themselves, but their clan as well.Sludir civilization remained unchallenged until a few years before the Galactic Civil War, when offworld slavers began capturing bands of Sludir warriors and selling them as gladiators. When Imperial scouts arrived on the Sludir homeworld, slavery had already weakened the Sludir caste structure. The Empire declared the Sludir a "Legitimate Slave Species" and destroyed the remnants of their intricate feudal caste society by exporting Sludir warriors, artisans, and workers to Imperial work camps throughout the galaxy.

A handful of enslaved Sludir escaped their captors and joined [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance). Many more joined criminal organizations, where their physical prowess made them excellent enforcers, pirates, bodyguards, and (Ironically) slavers. Regardless of allegiance, most Sludir resorted to violence and conflict to attain higher standing in whatever organization or society that would accept them.

The Sludir regained control of their homeworld after the Empire's fall. A new planetary government emerged, made up of a loose alliance of shady Sludir of varying dispositions, from genteel smugglers to vicious crime lords. Many liberated Sludir slaves returned to their homeworld, hoping to reunite with their clans or find others who respected their code of battle honor. Those appalled with the new state of the Sludir homeworld drifted to various corners of the galaxy in search of status, glory, or death by combat.

Although they are not technophobic, Sludir seldom embrace advanced technologies such as space travel and blasters, preferring hand-to-hand combat and intimidation to settle disputes.

### Sludir Characteristics
**Personality:** Sludir are direct and blunt. To them, physical strength and combat prowess bring power and prestige. Other than their sense of battle honor, they have little regard for etiquette and protocol, and acts of subterfuge appall them. They believe they deserve anything they can take by force.

**Physical Description:** Sludir have six legs and a humanoid torso. Hard shell-like plates protect their back and flanks. A Sludir's head consists mostly of a thick snout with four nostrils and a large, toothy sneer. Their thick manes are worn in different styles. A Sludir adult stands about 1.75 meters tall and measures about 2.3 meters long.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Sludir age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-12 Years | 13-40 Years | 41-55 Years | 56-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Sluudren](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sluudren), a rugged and isolated world in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** Sludese is a harsh-sounding language of grunts, snorts, and whinnies. There's no written Sludese language other than base-six mathematics. Sludir artisans traditionally conveyed ideas though intricate images, a practice replaced by written Basic during the Rebellion era.

**Example Names:** Chyanlev, Dukarz, Jyzatch, Kaylorz, Omze, Opolzur, Quintik Kahr, Ryzrytch, Shume, Webyllus, Zanjast Rahm.

**Adventurers:** The first Sludir to leave [Sluudren](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sluudren) were slaves, but many of them escaped slavery and became criminals, mercenaries, and soldiers. Their violent nature has made them a rare sight on developed worlds, but common on worlds known for their criminal activities. The majority of Sludir heroes become [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).
