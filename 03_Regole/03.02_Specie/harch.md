*Harch Species data created by TheSagaContinues user Serfious.*

Harch are an imposing humanoid, spider-like sentient [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). They posses six arms and six red eyes, as well as a pair of chelicerae near their mouths. The Harch are a fiercely independent Species, having never joined the Republic, and only joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the waning years of the Clones Wars. The Harch themselves live in communities of "Nests" along [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim), mostly situated in their homeworld of [Secundus Ando](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Secundus_Ando).

During the time of the Empire, Harch raiders fiercely fought against Imperial rule during what became known as the "Noolian Crisis," wherein Imperial forces pushed to root out what few Confederate sympathizers were left. Their efforts would unfortunately prove fruitless, as Captain Par Lankin's Imperial taskforce dealt a crippling blow to the resistance at the Battle of [Galboron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Galboron).

### Harch Characteristics
**Personality:** Harch are fiercely independent, highly valuing freedom and personal worth. The Harch are often slow and deliberate, making sure that every action they take has their intended effect. This is often confusing to other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), who find a Harch's caution unnerving.

**Physical Description:** The Harch possess a large-fanged mouth between two prominent chelicerae, above which are six red eyes arranged in a semicircle. The two lowest eyes are larger and roughly twice the size of the four smaller eyes. Harch walk on two legs and posses six arms, with the second and third set of arms protruding from behind the first pair rather than directly above or below them. These arms are covered in thick hair and end in three-fingered hands.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Harch age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 Years | 6-11 Years | 12-49 Years | 50-69 Years | 70-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Harch are native to [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim) planet of [Secundus Ando](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Secundus_Ando), a compound of Harch Nests and communities.

**Languages:** Harch speak their own language of clicks and hisses, which causes those that speak to develop a habit of clicking in between phrases.

**Example Names:** Ashton, Chiich, Ichiir, Trench.

**Adventurers:** Harch often leave their homeworld in search of inspiration, in hopes of discovering a new part of themselves. They often make acquaintances with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), although rarely do they form lasting bonds with others. Most Harch often make their way as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), although Force-sensitive Harch might instead become [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).
