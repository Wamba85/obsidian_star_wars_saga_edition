To survive the natural perils of their harsh, volcanic homeworld, the Sullustans evolved in the planet's numerous caves. They prefer to dwell underground, constructing highly advanced cities of such great beauty that wealthy sightseers come from all over the galaxy to visit them. Living underground helped the Sullustans to develop acute senses, and they are renowned for their navigational and piloting skills.

This friendly, gregarious species enjoys interacting with unique, unusual, and interesting beings. When Old Republic scouts first visited their homeworld, the Sullustans quickly embraced galactic civilization. The Sullustan manufacturing company SoroSuub is one of the largest non-[[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]-owned interstellar corporations in the galaxy. In fact, the company was so powerful that it has become the official government of [Sullust](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sullust), and more than half the plant's population is on its payroll.
