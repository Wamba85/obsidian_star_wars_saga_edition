*Tulgah Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

A rare sight in the galaxy, the Tulgahs are troll-like beings settled on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor) after the crashing of the colony ship *Free Enterprise* left them stranded. Inherently "magical" in nature, the secluded nature of Tulgahs and their extensive knowledge of [Totem Magic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Totem_Magic) has them viewed as mystical creatures to the other inhabitants of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). Many great Tulgahs have acted as skilled healers or kind wisemen to their neighbors in times of need, but the infamy of the dark witch Morag who twisted that knowledge to evil and wielded black magic against the peaceful villages of [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) has greatly harmed the Tulgahs' relations with [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes).
### Tulgah Characteristics
**Personality:** Tulgahs are typically kindly natured beings, always willing to aid their fellows when needed. However, their close ties to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) makes those that succumb to darkness have even further to fall, becoming bringers of stiff to [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

**Physical Description:** Tulgahs are mandrill-faced humanoids of short stature- standing less than one meter tall. They have yellowish, leathery skin covered with brown spots with snoutlike faces, and their limbs end in sharp claws.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Tulgahs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-19 Years | 20-109 Years | 110-149 Years | 150-199 Years | 200+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Rarely seen in the wider galaxy, the colony of Tulgahs on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) are the largest known concentration of the Species.

**Languages:** Their proximity to the [Jindas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jindas) and their shared history aboard the *Free Enterprise* caused the Tulgahs to adopt their language on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). Many learn Dulok or Ewokese to better communicate with their closest neighbors.

**Example Names:** Echrhin Isdan, Gipnur Dubik, Morag, Yukah Vekan.

**Adventurers:** Different Tulgahs put their abilities to different uses, some becoming great healers while others turn to evil pursuits. Most frequently as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), though more eccentric Tulgahs instead act as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).
### Tulgah Species Traits
Tulgahs share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Tulgahs receive a +2 bonus toÂ their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity). Tulgahs are well-learned, but have a poor sense of balance.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Tulgahs gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks.

- **Bonus Feat:** All Tulgahs receive the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Cooperative:** A Tulgah automatically succeeds when attempting to [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) on a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check), as long as the target is adjacent to, and can hear and understand, the Tulgah.
- **Primitive:** Tulgahs do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.

When a Tulgah makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d4 points of Slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage.
