The Lannik are a race of short humanoids native to the planet [Lannik](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lannik_(Planet)). Despite their size, Lannik are fierce warriors with skills honed from a dangerous world full of natural predators and a long history of warfare. They are stronger and quicker than their size would suggest, making them dangerous combatants. 

Lannik were taking their first small steps into space when [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/duros.md|Duros]] and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] explorers discovered them. The Republic soon accepted the Lannik as members, resulting in a massive influx of new trade and technology into the Lannik culture. Various political factions on [Lannik](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lannik_(Planet)) had different ideas about what compromised a reasonable trade for the new technologies and often argued bitterly over deals made by other groups of Lannik. This caused a serious social upheaval from which the Lannik never quite recovered. After several pirate organizations saw the divisive political situation as an ideal opportunity for making contacts, the Lannik homeworld harbored safe havens and black markets through which [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal) goods could be sold. In an effort to contract this social upheaval, many Core World governments tried to limit the amount of technology sold to the less advanced Lannik. Of course, this strengthened the impact of black market technology used by criminals and pirates to but influence there.

Eventually, Corellian diplomats offered to draw up agreements with the [Lannik](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lannik_(Planet)) planetary government to strengthen legitimate technological ties to the [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds). Various pirate-supported Lannik terrorist factions did their best to prevent the agreement from going into effect. The most powerful of these organizations, the Red Iaro, caused problems for the Lannik High Court for years. After the Empire's anti-alien policies came into play, both legitimate and criminal organizations reduced the flow of technology to [Lannik](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lannik_(Planet)), relegating it to the position of a galactic backwater. Having never colonized other planets, the Lannik remained isolated. Since then, they have rarely been seen off their homeworld.
