*Iotran Species data created by Wikia user Jdborghetti (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Iotrans are atheistic sentients who live and thrive within a strict military hierarchy. The Iotran people follow clear, codified laws that set the boundaries for conduct within their society. Iotrans strive for order and civility and believe in the maxim "might makes right." They abhor dissidence and lost considerable respect among non-Iotran cultures by showing open contempt for [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) and refusing to stand with the Alliance against the Empire.

Since the early days of the Republic, Iotrans have maintained an immense standing army bolstered by [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive)-capable Starships and blaster weapons. The army patrols the Iotran Expanse and has proven an effective deterrent against invasion, as Iotrans have never been involved in any military engagement larger than a border skirmish.

From youth, Iotrans are trained to prepare for conflict. By law, they must serve six standard years in the military, and of course, most of them consider it a privilege and honor to do so.
### Iotran Characteristics
**Personality:** Iotrans respect military might and little else. They fervently believe that order and stability are the building blocks of a thriving society. Iotrans have little to no respect for other cultures and their laws. They also have no sense of fair play, seeking victory in every conflict by the most expedient means. Iotrans are not technically minded, but they make good use of technology acquired from other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**Physical Description:** An Iotran has smooth, dark skin and a broad, flat nose. Distinctive spots adorn the top of an Iotran's distinctive skull, which features a pair of knobby protrusions that jut out between the eyes and ears. An Iotran has birdlike feet and hands with three fingers and a thumb. An Iotran adult stands about 1.75 meters tall and typically wears militaristic or utilitarian clothing.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Iotrans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-16 Years | 17-44 Years | 45-65 Years | 66-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Iotra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iotra) is an industrial planet in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) system of the same name. The Iotran Peacekeeping Force (IPF) rules Iotra through a Joint Council of eight top-ranking military leaders.

**Languages:** Iotrans speak Tranese, a rich language that has simple, precise sentence constructions and words. Most Iotrans learn to speak Basic, although they find it inelegant and convoluted.

**Example Names:** Anvon Trig, Dira Shal, Mirip Pag, Rodick Tag, Rova Zad, Terika Etan.

**Adventurers: **Due to the lack of respect Iotrans tend to have for alien cultures, they rarely venture far from [Iotra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iotra). The two exceptions are fugitives who flee Iotran space and the Iotran Bracemen (highly skilled bounty hunters) sent to retrieve them. Iotran Force-users are uncommon, but no more so then rumors of secret Iotran cabals trained in the ways of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi).
