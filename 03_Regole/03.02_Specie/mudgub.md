*Mudgub Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

An amphibious Species of tribal swamp-dwellers, the Mudgubs are residents of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) whose isolated leaves them cut off from the majority of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes). Nestled between the petty and aggressive [Gorphs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gorphs), and the charming but overoptimistic [Titterbugs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Titterbugs), Mudgubs have struggled to eke out their place in the Forest Moon. While their [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/titterbug.md|Titterbug]] allies have prevented them from being overwhelmed by their more aggressive neighbors, their overconfidence paired with the Mudgubs unobservant nature have left the two imperiled by the ever-encroaching Gorph grottos.
### Mudgub Characteristics
**Personality:** Mudgubs are a peaceful people, whose proximity to the [Gorphs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gorphs) has done nothing to break their spirits. They can be oblivious to the dangers around them, but are fearless when those threats do come to bear.

**Physical Description:** Mudgubs are gray-skinned bipeds less than half a meter tall. They had long, thin legs that splay out and set their bodies close to the ground. A long, wispy tail grows from a Mudgub, ending in a barbed point.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Mudgubs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-6 Years | 7-16 Years | 17-44 Years | 45-59 Years | 60-69 Years | 70+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor); Mudgubs live in the swampy marshes bordering the [Titterbugs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Titterbugs) and [Gorphs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gorphs). Few others are able to reach their isolated domain.

**Languages:** Mudgubs speak their own croaking language. Tribal leaders tend to learn either Gorphese to appease their more hostile neighbors, or Titterese to draw closer with their insectoid allies.

**Example Names:** Jutpad, Kitbak, Pacmut, Zadben.

**Adventurers:** Mudgub [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are most common tribal members, helping to stave off the dangers of their homeworld. A handful instead lead their tribes as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), with a very rare few able to help their tribes prosper as [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).

- **Fearless:** Mudgubs gain a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) to resist both Fear effects, as well as the [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) application of the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill.
