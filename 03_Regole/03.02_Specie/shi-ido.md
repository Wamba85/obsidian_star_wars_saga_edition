*Shi'ido Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Despite their secretive nature, Shi'ido cannot resist the urge to travel the galaxy and learn about other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). Little is known about them except that they can take the form of virtually any other humanoid [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) they wish. They go to great lengths, short of violence, to guard their Species' secrets.

The Shi'ido explore the galaxy with no agenda other than to learn about other cultures. Shi"ido travel from world to world aboard [Space Transports](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Transports), drawing as little attention to themselves as possible. Occasionally Shi'ido will stumble upon a planet they like and will spend the rest of their long lives there, mastering the local customs and insinuating themselves into the daily lives of the indigenous [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
### Shi'ido Characteristics
**Personality:** Shi'ido are curious, shy, and secretive. They prefer to avoid confrontations, especially on their homeworld, where they'll pretend to be innocuous aliens, harmless creatures, boulders or trees to avoid outlanders. They understand that some other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) fear their shapeshifting abilities and are thus reticent to call attention to themselves.

**Physical Description:** ln their natural form, Shi'ido are humanoids with pale, hairless skin. They stand about 1.8 meters tall. They have thin, dense bones, double joints, and elasticized tendons, which helps them assume the appearance of virtually any other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Shi'ido age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-60 Years | 61-210 Years | 211-360 Years | 361-500 Years | 501+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Lao-mon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lao-mon) (Sh'shuun in Shi'idese), a tropical world in [The Colonies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Colonies) region populated by large predators. No expedition to [Lao-mon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lao-mon) has yielded evidence that the Shi'ido- or any other sentient [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species)- ever lived there. It's assumed that the Species' ability to change shape has protected them from discovery and predators.

**Languages:** Shi'idese is an ancient language that incorporates a wide range of vocalizations. Xenobiologists are uncertain whether a written form of Shi'idese exists. Shi'ido can learn to speak and read other languages and those who venture from their homeworld are quick to master Basic.

**Example Names:** Shi'ido change their names as often as they change forms, although a Shi'ido who settles on a world might keep the same name for hundreds of years. Sample names include Akarren Duufor, Borborygmus Gog, Mammon Hoole, lsoh Rykken. Shall Screel, and Xev Tallus. 

**Adventurers:** Dozens of Shi'ido roam the galaxy, disguised as any number of different beings. Many governments have tried to keep close tabs on suspected Shi'ido, to no avail. Shi'ido heroes can belong to any non-[Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) Heroic Class; the Shi'ido fear [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) and their uncanny perceptiveness.
