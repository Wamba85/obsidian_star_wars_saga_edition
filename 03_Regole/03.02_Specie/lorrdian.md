*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Jedi Masters (Part 1)*

Lorrdians prove that history is as important as planetary climate in shaping a society. During the Kanz Disorders, the Lorrdians were enslaved; their masters, the [Argazdans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Argazdans), forbade them from communicating with each other. This could have destroyed their culture within a couple of generations, but the Lorrdians adapted. They devised an extremely intricate language of subtle hand gestures, body postures, and subtle facial tics and expressions. This was vital to survival during their enslavement- by learning how to interpret the body postures, gestures, and vocal intonations of their masters, they could learn how to respond to situations and survive. They maintained their cultural identity in the face of adversity.

At first, this new language was little more than a battle tongue, a way of keeping guerrilla groups informed of activities. The Lorrdian culture has celebrated and developed this language; each succeeding generation has been taught the system, and each has been taught how to read the movements, gestures, and mannerisms of others. This has resulted in a race of people who are much more aware of the actions and movements of others. Lorrdians are so perceptive that they can tell a person's mood and intent with just a few seconds of observation. With more study, they can often determine cultural background, homeworld, occupation, social class, and a number of other factors that few non-Lorrdians would be able to ascertain based solely on distanced observation.
