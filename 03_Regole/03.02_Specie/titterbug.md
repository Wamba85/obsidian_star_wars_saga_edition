*Titterbug Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Sentient insectoids native to the badlands of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), Titterbugs are perpetually cheery beings whose relative isolation has largely cut them off from [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes). The majority are united under their monarchical kingdom, with Titterbug colonies providing support against external dangers. While they still contend with [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/skandit.md|Skandit]] raiders and arrogant kingdoms of [Gorphs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gorphs), allies of the Titterbugs are the [Mudgubs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mudgubs), who are similarly pressured by their fellow swamp-dwellers. Nonetheless, Titterbugs have maintained a strong sense of community, and remain an important member of the Forest Moon's community.
### Titterbug Characteristics
**Personality:** Despite their pressure from outside threats Titterbugs remain steadfast optimists, always certain of a better next day. Their loyalty to their allied tribes of [Mudgubs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mudgubs) is also a point of pride, viewing them as part of their own communities.

**Physical Description:** Titterbugs have six limbs, standing upright on four while the other two serve as fine manipulators. Their insectoid carapaces range in color between dull reds with muddy brown markings, They also have hair matching in color with their carapaces' markings.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Titterbugs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-4 Years | 5-14 Years | 15-39 Years | 40-49 Years | 50-59 Years | 60+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Titterbugs live in the badlands of [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor). Their contact with [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) is bottlenecks by the [Gorphs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gorphs), who extract tribute for the privilege of outside contact, dissuading even the most adventurous of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gupin.md|Gupin]] merchants.

**Languages:** Titterbugs speak Titterese, with most also learning Mudgub in solidarity with their allied tribes. By necessity, Gorphese is also an important dialect for more worldly Titterbugs.

**Example Names:** Bipperguard, Kendiforager, Septifarmer, Yatiprincess.

**Adventurers:** Titterbugs are most at home in the role of [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), though a few more mischievous ones find equal success as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels). Titterbugs of other [Heroic Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes) are comparatively less common, usually acting as guards to their vulnerable communities.
