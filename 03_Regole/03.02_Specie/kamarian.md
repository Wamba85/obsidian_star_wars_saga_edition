*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

The Kamarians are an insect-like species native to [Kamar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kamar). During [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times), the most technologically advanced Kamarians have just developed nuclear weapons, and are well on their way to developing clean fusion and spaceflight. Despite this, they still live in a feudal society. They organize themselves into small tribes or city-states called tk'skquas which often battled each other for territory.

Kamarians are divided into several subraces, distinguished by size, carapace color, language, and culture. The most numerous and technologically advanced Kamarians are the mountain dwellers, whose tk'skquas live in mountain cave systems. Another group of special note are the "Badlanders," a group native to the Kamar Badlands. Badlanders are slightly smaller than other Kamarians, and are also hardier, able to survive even longer without water and adapted to even higher temperatures.
### Kamarian Characteristics
**Personality:** Kamarians are territorial people, known for conflict. They often live in small groups, though larger civilizations inhabit mountain cave structures across [Kamar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kamar).

**Physical Description:** Kamarians have round heads with large compound eyes, four arms, two legs, and prehensile tails. They had segmented bodies covered in an exoskeleton which sealed water within their bodies. This allows them to go for up to twenty-five days without water before feeling the effects of dehydration. Most adult Kamarians stand between 1.3 and 1.7 meters high.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Kamarians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-13 Years | 14-19 Years | 20-69 Years | 70-94 Years | 95-122 Years | 123+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Kamar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kamar) is an arid world in [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space), close to [The Corporate Sector](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Corporate_Sector).

**Languages:** The isolation of Kamar means few Kamarians are able to learn more commonplace languages, Kamarian is a general term for the many different dialects and regional variants of the native language.

**Example Names:** Lisstik, Maashan.

**Adventurers:** Most Kamarians find success as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), though Kamarian [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) are also commonplace. [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are comparatively less successful, given the Kamarians' natural traits.
### Kamarian Species Traits
Kamarians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Kamarians receive a +2 bonus to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Kamarians are hardy and resilient, but are overly territorial in their attitudes.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Kamarians have no special bonuses or penalties due  to their size.
- **Speed:** Kamarians have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Desert Dweller:** When making [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) checks to resist the effects of [Extreme Heat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Heat), Kamarians can reroll the check, keeping the better of the two results.
- **Multiple Limbs:** Kamarians have an extra set of manipulative limbs. When making multiple attacks, a Kamarian reduces the penalty to its attack rolls by 2.
- **Prehensile Tail:** A Kamarian's tail can effectively hold (but not wield) a Small or smaller item. When holding a Medium or larger item with his or her tail, a Kamarian is encumbered and is considered to be carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Kamarians can speak, read, and write Kamarian.
