*Aing-Tii Species data created by Wikia user Darthauthor.*

Very little is known about the Aing-Tii. Their existence is a secret shared by relatively few individuals who have met Aing-Tii Monks. Even then, the meetings take place aboard their ships. In recent history, the Aing-Tii are known to patrol the space known as the Kathol Rift and do not interact very much with the inhabitants of the region.

By the end of the Clone Wars, [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order) learns of The Aing-Tii Monks' existence and knows that the Aing-Tii are decidedly uninterested in [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi). A few years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), Master Yoda sends a former smuggler named Jorj Car'das to the Aing-Tii to ask for their help in countering his failing health. The Monks agree to assist on the condition that Jorj stays with them to learn their ways. Several years pass before the Monks allow Jorj Car'das to leave their company and spend the rest of his life on Exocron, a world in the Kathol Outback.

Four years after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), [The Aing-Tii Monks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Aing-Tii_Monks) begin a search for what they call the Codex, an ancient piece of Darkstryder technology they believe to be sacred. Convinced that they cannot physically touch it, they abduct a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] navigator named Makezh, erase his memories, and implant a subconscious command to seek out and obtain the Codex for them. The Monks' knowledge of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] physiology is limited, however, and Makezh becomes mildly insane as a result of the operation. The search concludes on the planet [Demonsgate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Demonsgate), a lone world beyond the Kathol Rift. The Aing-Tii take the Codex, Makezh, and several Imperial Stormtroopers for study.

After the conclusion of the Yuuzhan Vong War in 25 ABY, the Jedi Knight Jacen Solo travels to the Kathol Rift and studies with [The Aing-Tii Monks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Aing-Tii_Monks). Although the Monks view Solo as an unsound student, they teach him about Flow-Walking and how to use the ability. Though Solo files a report of his time spent with [The Aing-Tii Monks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Aing-Tii_Monks), much of the information Solo learned is deliberately withheld.
### Aing-Tii Characteristics
**Personality:** The Aing-Tii believe that [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) has multiple aspects very much like a rainbow. Within these aspects, [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) moves and acts in ways that guide and help life in all of its forms, and no single aspect is more important than the others. In order for one to truly understand the nature of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), one must experience a little of each facet and gain a semblance of the entire spectrum.

**Physical Description:** The Aing-Tii are a species of sentient, toothless mammals standing about two meters tall. Their bodies are covered entirely in jointed protective coverings of white, bony plates, which extend up past their necks and onto their heads, appearing like a protective helmet. Each Aing-Tii has a long, prehensile tail that can be used in self-defense. The Aing-Tii each have painted motifs covering their entire bodies, unique to each Aing-Tii. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Aing-Tii age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-17 Years | 18-62 Years | 63-94 Years | 95-129 Years | 130+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Their homeworld is hidden somewhere within the Kathol Rift, kept away from outsiders. 

**Languages:** Aing-Tii communicate amongst each other through the literal use of their six tongues. Only those adventures who venture beyond the veil or have studied the language of other cultures would know languages other than their own. 

**Example Names:** Ben'Sur, Kulan'Pa, Laman'So, Looshen'Fel, Tadar'Ro, Te'Nuriel.

**Adventurers:** In truth, not all of the Aing-Tii are Force-sensitive, but they do have a higher percentage of Force-users compared with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). As such, many Aing-Tii find success in any of the [Heroic Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes), particularly as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts).
### Aing-Tii Species Traits
Aing-Tii share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Aing-Tii receive a +2 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Aing-Tii have reached a sort of self-enlightenment amongst themselves, but they can find difficulty relating to other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Aing-Tii have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Aing-Tii have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Carapace:** Aing-Tii gain a +1 Natural Armor bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +1 Natural Armor bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). A Natural Armor bonus stacks with an Armor bonus.
- **Prehensile Tail:** An Aing-Tii's tail can effectively hold (but not wield) a Small or smaller item. When holding a Medium or larger item with his or her tail, an Aing-Tii is encumbered and is considered to be carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Stoic:** Aing-Tii mannerisms make them difficult for other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to get an accurate read on. Any creature attempting to use the [Sense Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Deception) or [Sense Influence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Influence) applications of the [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) skill on an Aing-Tii takes a -5 penalty to the skill check.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Aing-Tii can speak, read, and write Aing-Tii.
