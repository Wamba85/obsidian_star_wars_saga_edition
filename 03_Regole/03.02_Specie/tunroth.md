*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Species Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Species_Sourcebook)*

The Tunroth were simple hunters before [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/duros.md|Duros]] scouts discovered them during an exploration of the Jiroch System nearly 9,000 years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin). Although access to galactic-level technology allowed the Tunroth to colonize other planets in their home system, they continued to favor primitive weapons over modern blasters, preferring to hunt wild beasts armed only with the sacred Klirun, the traditional Tunroth hunting [Bow](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bow).

Ten years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), expansionist Lortan fanatics swept across a dozen systems and destroyed everything in their path. The Reslian Purge, as it became known, wiped out millions of Tunroth. The primitive hunters lacked the weaponry to repel the Lortan invaders. The intervention of the Imperial Navy ended the Reslian Purge, and although the Imperials interceded only to safeguard their own interests, the Tunroth still owed the Empire a debt of gratitude. The Species reluctantly accepted Imperial rule, and many Tunroth became unlikely supporters of the Emperor's New Order. After the fall of the Empire, the Tunroth hesitated to join [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) for fear of being seen as Imperial sympathizers. However, their fears proved unfounded, as [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) welcomed Tunroth membership.

The Tunroth live in communes of 50 to 300 individuals, each commune governed by a great hunter. The Assemblage of Three- a body made up of the three highest-level hunters- governs Tunroth society. They assemble whenever an issue that concerns all Tunroth arises, such as the need to colonize more worlds, alleviate overcrowding, or deal with an external threat.

Tunroth leaders who forbade blasters in favor of traditional hunting weapons changed their view after the Reslian Purge, to the point where the Tunroth now stockpile blasters and other modern weapons for the express purpose of defending their communes. The Species' adoption of modern weaponry has not diminished the Tunroth hunting tradition. 27 different levels of Tunroth hunter are known to exist, and each has its own strict guidelines for ascension. The highest of the 27 ranks is *Stiilran*, though no hunters of this class are known to exist during the time of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic), [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire), or [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic).

It has long been rumored that some Jedi artifact, such as a temple or hidden tomb, lies somewhere in the Jiroch System. However, the Tunroth fervently deny these tales.
