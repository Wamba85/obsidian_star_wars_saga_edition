*Anx Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Anx are serene giants who assume many roles in the Republic. They are placid, sociable creatures noted for an almost-fanatical devotion to any larger group of which they consider themselves a part. 

Thousands of years before the Republic encountered them, the Anx developed interstellar travel by hurling their ships into orbit with colossal cannons. Through this method, the Anx spread from [Gravlex Med](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gravlex_Med) (their homeworld) to neighboring systems in their corner of space. Unfortunately for them, they quickly encountered the [Shusugaunt](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shusugaunt), a squat Species of spacefaring warriors. Although the Shusugaunt managed to take over the Anx homeworld for a short time, the planet's gravity proved their undoing, bringing the conquest to a halt. Since then, Anx have become more cautious in their exploration and dealings with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

Anx possess an uncanny knowledge of anatomy, specifically relating to nervous systems, muscles, and skeletal structures (even in creatures they have never encountered before). This knowledge makes the Anx devastating unarmed combatants, able to stop even a raging [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/wookiee.md|Wookiee]] with a well-placed blow to the right nerve center.

### Anx Characteristics
**Personality:** Anx are serene beings. They are highly sociable, given to large families and complex social structures. They fear isolation.

**Physical Description:** Anx average 4 meters tall and would seem taller if they didn't walk with their shoulders stooped and their long, crested heads held out in front of them. Their skins- and particularly the fins beneath their crests- change color to reflect their emotions. When traveling among aliens, Anx often wear cowled cloaks that hide their crests. Their slow, hunched way of walking, together with their small, close-set eyes, wrinkled faces, and pursed mouths can make them look like parodies of old men. An Anx's large, muscular tail serves as a counterbalance for running.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Anx age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-15 Years | 16-54 Years | 55-79 Years | 80-109 Years | 110+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Gravlex Med](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gravlex_Med), a high-gravity world located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** Anx speak and read Anx. Their head-crests contain enormous sinuses that generate booming, low-frequency tones that other Anx can hear from several kilometers away. Offworld Anx often speak Basic, and descendants of Anx who survived the [Shusugaunt](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shusugaunt) invasion also speak Shusugaunt.

**Example Names:** Graxol Kelvyyn, Horox Ryyder, Theen Fida, Drexol Ryyd.

**Adventurers:** Anx adventurers can by any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class), although they are rarely encountered as [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). Anx [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) are more common during [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times).
### Anx Species Traits
Anx share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Anx receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Anx are large and powerful, but are overanxious and make the wrong kinds of friends.
- **Large Size:** As Large creatures, Anx take a -1 size penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a -5 size penalty on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks, and they gain a +5 size bonus to their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). Their lifting and carrying limits are double those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Anx have a base speed of 8 squares.
- **Bellow:** As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), an Anx can use its booming voice to release an incredible Bellow. The Anx makes a special attack roll (1d20 + its Character Level) and compares the result to the [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) of all creatures and unattended objects in a 6-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone). A successful hit deals 3d6 points of [Sonic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic) damage; if the attack misses, the target takes half damage instead.
    - Each use of this ability moves the Anx -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
    - An Anx can choose to add more dice (d6s) to the damage it deals with its Bellow, but each additional 1d6 of damage moves the Anx another -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
- **Empathy:** Anx add their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) bonus (if any) to [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks made to [Sense Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Deception) or [Sense Influence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Influence).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Anx can speak, read, and write both Anx and Shusugaunt.
