The Skrillings are a Species of galactic scavengers. When a Species called the [M'shinni](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/M'shinni) colonized the Skrillings homeworld, the Skrillings were little more than primitive nomadic herders. The [M'shinni](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/M'shinni) fenced in the Skrilling herds, claimed their land, and left the primitive, peaceful aliens to figure out how to survive. Within a few generations, the Skrillings had integrated themselves into [M'shinni](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/M'shinni) colonies on the world as a permanent beggar class. From there, they expanded into the rest of the galaxy.

Many [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) view Skrillings as disgusting annoyances. They devour uncooked, spoiled meat that would make other beings deathly ill, and they have elevated whining to an art form. When a Skrilling sets their heart on something, he or she continually asks for it, continually rephrasing the question. Various strategies for sharing the object or achieving whatever goal the Skrilling has in mind are suggested, and small gifts or favors are offered as a form of exchange. If the possessor of an object relocates, the Skrilling sometimes even shows up again, even in a different star system. A Skrilling usually gets what he or she wants; they are experts at finding a person's "Soft Spot." Most Skrillings are bright enough, however, to know when someone they are pestering has been pushed to the point where he or she is about to get violent. ln such cases, they give up their desire- at least temporarily.

The Skrillings can be found throughout the settled galaxy, traveling in spacecraft cobbled together from various derelicts. They have an innate ability to show up on planets where a battle has been fought and well-aged (And unclaimed) corpses can be found, along with equipment that can be repaired and resold. This tendency has given rise to the saying that an enemy will soon be "Skrillings fodder."

Skrillings often lurk on the fringes of violent criminal organizations or live near the torture chambers of unscrupulous despots- anywhere a steady supply of dead bodies and other carrion can be found. During the Galactic Civil War, however, many Skrillings also served as valuable spies for [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance), due to their ability to uncover information.

**Physical Description:** Skrillings are stocky humanoids with wrinkled gray skin, stubby fingers, and small deep-set eyes. Instead of a nose or nostrils, they sport a se of eight breathing tubes; Their mouths have multiple rows of needle-sharp teeth. A bony crest adorns the top of a Skrilling's bald head, extending from the forehead to the nape of the neck. Skrilling newborns use their head-crests to saw through the shell of the birth-eggs; the crest serves no other function.
