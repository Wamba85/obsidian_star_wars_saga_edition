*Turazza Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty.*

Relative newcomers to the galaxy, the Turazza have only joined galactic civilization in the past century before the rise of the Empire. Unique to Turazza is their inherent bonding to other beings. Those they bond with are closely adhered to, both out of a sense of loyalty and fealty to the bonded individual. Hard workers, Turazza's strength, size, and numbers make them valuable assets to the workforce. This, coupled with their group mentality and their inability to communicate with the world around them, results in many Turazza being taken advantage of or enslaved, and it is incredibly rare to see any Turazza in a place of leadership.

### Turazza Characteristics
**Personality:** Turazza took bonds very seriously; brotherhoods and sisterhoods work closely together and, should one of them desert the group, the others spend a mourning period of several days keening loudly, going without sleep or food. The Turazza are loyal beings, and enjoy aiding those they bond with.

**Physical Description:** Turazza are reptilian sentients covered with mottled red or green scales, with mottled spots ranging from between red, purple, and green. Their upper jaw extends out from their head, ending in three pointed teeth. Their mouth jaw is completely bitten under this long snout. Turazza are extremely short-statured, reaching only the waist of an adult [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Turazza age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-14 Years | 15-33 Years | 34-47 Years | 48-559 Years | 60+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Any information on the planetary origins of the Turazza has been long lost to galactic history.

**Languages:** The Turazza language includes short squeaks, heeps and meeps that sounded savage to members of other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). Rarely is a non-Turazza fluent in Turazza, and in turn the shape of a Turazza's jaw means few are capable of speaking Basic.

**Example Names:** Nizzal, Rizzal, Vizzal.

**Adventurers:** Turazza are hard workers and their strength, size, and numbers made them valuable assets to the workforce, as well as some potential slavers. Most of Turazza work as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). Turazza Force-users are rare, and few could ever find success as a [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble).
