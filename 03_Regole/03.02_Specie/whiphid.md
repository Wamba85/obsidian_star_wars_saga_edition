Whiphids are nomadic hunters, living on and making seasonal migrations across the vast tundra of their homeworld. Whiphid society is primitive and tribal, with each tribe led by a Spearmaster. They live for the hunt and the thrill of the kill. When they were discovered by traders during [The Old Republic Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era), the Whiphids were quite taken with the traders' technology. Since that time, numerous Whiphids have left their tribes behind in search of a lucrative and more comfortable life elsewhere in the galaxy.

### Whiphid Characteristics

**Personality:** Whiphids are natural predators. They enjoy the hunt as much as the kill. Outsiders might be surprised by their agreeable and outgoing personalities, especially when some Whiphid must learn the difference between "Friend" and "Food" the hard way. A combination of greed and lack of scruples lead many into the shady side of galactic society.

**Physical Description:** Whiphids are bulky bipeds covered in light brown or golden fur. A Whiphid's lower jaw sports two large tusks. Whiphids vary in bulk and size depending on the climate they live in. They often shed some weight on hotter worlds to prevent overheating. 

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Whiphid stands 2.5 meters tall and weighs 55 kilograms.

[Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) are uncommon. Force-sensitive Whiphids are rare, but not unheard of.
