*Melitto Species data created by TheSagaContinues user Serfious.*

Melitto are a Species of insectile humanoids native to the planet [Li-Toran](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Li-Toran). They have no eyes or mouth, but are capable of sensing their environment using super-sensitive cilia. Melitto had chitin plates on their heads and forearms, and required the use of breathing tubes when operating in alien atmospheres.

Melitto are eusocial beings who live in hives, ruled by queens and their adolescent female servants- called Myrmitrices- who in turn control their own stables of male workers- or Myrmites- who gather food, built the physical hive structure, and battle other hives. Whenever a hive's population increased too much for it to operate at full efficiency, it became necessary to found a new hive. The Myrmitrices then started fighting each other with the help of their warrior followers. When a victor emerged, she gained the right to be queen of a new hive. The Myrmites who had the misfortune of surviving their Myrmitrix's defeat were cast away from their hive, becoming Ronin. Most Ronin leave their homeworld to become expert hunters and thieves; some, however, are rumored to found their own queenless communities in the subterranean caves of their planet.

### Melitto Characteristics
**Personality:** Melitto within their hives work well with their hive members, tending to keep to themselves. Exiled Melitto (Ronin) become far more independent, often finding work in the less desirable areas of the law.

**Physical Description:** With a body comprising a head, a torso, two legs, two arms, and five-fingered hands, the Melitto were humanoids. Nevertheless, the segmented plates of chitin visible on their heads and hairy forearms betrayed their insectile nature. The Melitto face was covered in four plates, the largest being at the top, but do not feature visible eyes or a mouth.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Melitto age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-6 Years | 7-12 Years | 13-49 Years | 50-64 Years | 65-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld: **The Melitto evolved on [Li-Toran](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Li-Toran), a dismal and storm-buffeted planet situated in [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Inner_Rim).

**Languages:** The Melitto language consisted of humming sounds produced by their facial plates. To communicate with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), they wear special [Vox-Boxes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vox-Boxes) that translate their hums into an understandable voice.

**Example Names:** Jakka Shiro, Mrimmin Jou, Sarco Plank, Toran.
