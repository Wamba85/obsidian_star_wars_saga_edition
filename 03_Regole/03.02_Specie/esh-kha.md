*Esh-kha Species data created by Wikia user Jdborghetti.*

During [The Pre-Republic Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pre-Republic_Era), a warmongering Species of destroyers scourged the ancient galaxy. Known as the Esh-kha, this race of conquerors had set it upon themselves to cleanse the galaxy of all other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) whom the Esh-kha believed were abominations that had to be purged. Culturally, the Esh-kha act as something of a synchronous hive-mind though made up of individuals with free will these individuals operate according to the rigid needs and casts of [The Esh-kha Collective](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Esh-kha_Collective) with little room for disagreement or individual agency.

The marauding Esh-kha destroyed dozens of slave worlds that belonged to [The Infinite Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Infinite_Empire), eventually attracted the attention of the fearsome [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/rakata.md|Rakata]] who assembled a massive military force against this threat. The resulting conflict is the largest scale conflict of this era, covering all the known galaxy at the time, and left the few surviving Esh-kha imprisoned on [Belsavis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Belsavis).

By [The Great Galactic War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Great_Galactic_War), the security systems of [Belsavis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Belsavis) began to break down, leading to the Esh-kha being freed from stasis. Once freed, they began to resume their campaign of ruthless expansion and zealous combat. As time moved on, they continue to recover more technology and strange weapons as they attempt to return back to the stars.
