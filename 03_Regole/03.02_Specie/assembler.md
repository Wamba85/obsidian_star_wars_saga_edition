*Assembler Species data created by Wikia user Darthauthor.*

Assemblers are a rare species of sentient arachnoids known for their unique space nests. Their origins have been lost, but they now wander the galaxy in the "Webs" they fashion in the vacuum of space. 

The Web an Assembler "inherits" is an organic extension of itself, operating much like a Starship. However, lacking any means of propulsion, sensors, or weapons a Web is more analogous to a small space station. Some Assemblers instead choose to "acquire" a more conventional ship, building its own Web within it. Such crafts still require a full crew without [Slave Circuits](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Slave_Circuits).

### Assembler Characteristics
**Personality:** Assemblers are solitary creatures and appear to only deal with others as a means to an end.

**Physical Description:** Assemblers are giant, green-black arachnoids with a bulbous body and six chitinous legs. Additionally, Assemblers have silken knobs growing on their backs, both for particle collection and web secretions.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Assemblers age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-20 Years | 21-100 Years | 101-650 Years | 651-1,200 Years | 1,201-2,000 Years | 2,001+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Unknown, though Assemblers have adapted to survive in space itself.

**Languages:** Assemblers communicate through neural nodes within their webs. When dealing with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), Assemblers are perfectly capable of spoken languages, including Basic.

**Example Names:** Balancesheet, Calculator, Docker, Handler, Identifier, Lookout, Signaler.

**Adventurers:** Assemblers are largely isolationist, but are perfectly willing to make use of others when the opportunities are available. In keeping with this mindset, most Assemblers favor the [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) and [Scoundrel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel) Heroic Classes.
