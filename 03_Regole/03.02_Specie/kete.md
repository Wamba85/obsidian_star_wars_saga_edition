*Kete Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Scattered communities of insectoid builders, Ketes are a close-knit people that live in towering hives on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). They manufacture a sticky substance allowing for the creation of their massive homes, and is greatly envied by [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) for its sturdy nature. They similarly create their nectar in isolation, allowing Ketes to subsist entirely independent of the other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) on the Forest Moon.
