Miraluka are remarkably similar to [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), except for two important and distinctive differences. Miraluka have no eyes, but they have a natural ability to "see" by using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Since they appear [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]- including their speech and mannerisms- Miraluka attempt to blend with [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) when traveling throughout the galaxy.

Thus, estimating how often they travel or how many live off their home planet of [Alpheridies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alpheridies) is difficult, but the number is relativity low. To make matters worse, the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus consumed the colony of [Katarr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Katarr) after [The Jedi Civil War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Civil_War). Currently, no major centers of Miraluka life exist outside of their homeworld and colonies, though individuals might be encountered anywhere in the galaxy.

It is highly unusual for an entire sapient Species to be Force-sensitive. Given their connection to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), it is common for Miraluka to join [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order). In fact, several Miraluka became central figures in shaping the Jedi traditions after [The Jedi Civil War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Civil_War). The strength of a Miraluka's connection to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) varies by individual. Miraluka who are not powerful enough to become full-fledged Jedi serve the Order in supporting roles. Most live lives similar to that of a normal [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]].

Miraluka and [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) tend not to intermarry, given the unpredictable and often unhappy genetic results. A rare exception is Krynda, daughter of a Miraluka father and a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] mother. She was born with both Force Sight and functioning [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] eyes.

### Miraluka Species Traits
Miraluka share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Miraluka receive a +2 bonus to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity). Miraluka have keen minds, but their reliance on [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to perceive their surroundings prevents them from reacting as quickly as most.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Miraluka have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Miraluka have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Miraluka who has [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-training.md|Force Training]] as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Force Sight:** Although blind, Miraluka can "see" by using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). They act normally, without taking any penalties for blindness when in the presence of living creatures, or life of any kind. This trait enables them to make [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks, and read and write as a sighted person.
    - They can ignore the effect of darkness as if they had Darkvision. Miraluka cannot, however, detect creatures that are "invisible" to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) such as the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] and the [Ysalamiri](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ysalamiri). These creatures have [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment) from Miraluka, as do creatures in areas the dampen or suppress [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).
    - Additionally, Miraluka ignore all penalties to [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks from [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) and [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (but not [Total Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Cover) or [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)). Miraluka do not increase the DC of [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks made to [Sense Surroundings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Surroundings) against targets with [Total Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Cover).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Miraluka can speak, read (through their Force Sight), and write (through their Force Sight) both Basic and Miralukese.
