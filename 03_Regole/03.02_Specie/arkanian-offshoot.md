The Arkanian Offshoots are a subspecies of the [Arkanians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanians), genetically engineered by the infamous [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/arkanian.md|Arkanian]] scientists and genetic researchers in [The Old Republic Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Old_Republic_Era).

Known to be unscrupulous when it came to the bounds of scientific exploration, the geneticists of [Arkania](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkania) began to experiment on their own Species, mixing the blood of other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) with their own to create Offshoots of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/arkanian.md|Arkanian]] Species. These Arkanian Offshoots were first bred to excel at specific industrial tasks such as mechanical or technical work in order to relieve Pureblooded [Arkanians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanians) of physical labor. One particular subspecies were bred as workers for the famed [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/arkanian.md|Arkanian]] gem mines. These people had five-fingered hands and eyes resembling those of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] race with which their blood was mixed. With stark white skin, the Arkanian Offshoots were easily distinguished from the Purebloods and were often shunned, even if covertly. Among the other races the Arkanian's experimented with were the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/sephi.md|Sephi]] of [Thustra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thustra), a Species of humanoids with pointed ears.

Developed in the era surrounding [The Great Sith War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Great_Sith_War), the Arkanian Offshoots were bred as an answer to the need for laborers to mine the vast diamond stores of [Arkania](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkania). This subspecies was especially vulnerable to minor [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/arkanian.md|Arkanian]] illnesses. The Arkanian Offshoots were treated as second-class or non-citizens by the Pureblooded [Arkanians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanians), and the question over what to do with them was termed the "Offshoot Question."

Arkoh Adasca planned to use Adascorp's genetic engineering expertise to solve the problem in a generation. Indeed his grandfather, Argaloh Adasca, attempted to exterminate the Arkanian Offshoots with a plague that ravaged those of advanced age. Nearing the end of the Mandalorian Wars, Arkanian Offshoots died out and became mostly extinct due to their rather weak immune systems, along with the [Arkanians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkanians) halting the experiments that created more of the genetically altered subspecies.

### Arkanian Offshoot Characteristics
**Personality:** Due to the constant discrimination by the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/arkanian.md|Arkanian]] Purebloods, most Arkanian Offshoots have much more humble attitudes when compared to their Pureblooded cousins. Rather than arrogance, most Arkanian Offshoots have a quiet confidence in their skills. Those that flee from [Arkania](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkania) are often among the most driven individuals of a group, determined to prove themselves to be more than an [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/arkanian.md|Arkanian]] slave.

**Physical Description:** Arkanian Offshoots are are bipedal humanoids with a [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) appearance. They have pure white skin, making them easily identifiable from the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/arkanian.md|Arkanian]] Purebloods, and possess five digited fingers (as opposed to the Arkanians' four). A rare few Arkanian Offshoots have unique traits as well, such as pointed ears, or an exotic eye color.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Arkanian Offshoot stands 1.8 meters tall and weighs 75 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Arkanian Offshoots age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-13 Years | 14-30 Years | 31-45 Years | 46-55 Years | 56+ Years |

**Homeworld:** While originally hailing from the frozen world of [Arkania](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Arkania), most Arkanian Offshoots have fled their homeworld and are scattered across the galaxy, hiding in the lower reaches of society.

**Languages:** Arkanian Offshoots speak both Basic, as well as an older dialect of Arkanian.

**Example Names:** Edessa, Gorman, Vandrayk, Jarael, Zadawi.

**Adventurers:** Arkanian Offshoots are typically any non-[Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) Heroic Class that complements the task they were engineered for. However, most offworld Arkanian Offshoots become [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) as a matter of survival, and those few Force-sensitive Arkanian Offshoots that do appear tend to self-train themselves as [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigies).

### Arkanian Offshoot Species Traits
Arkanian Offshoots share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Arkanian Offshoots either have a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) or [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) depending on their genetic engineering, but all suffer from a -2 penalty to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Arkanian Offshoots have been genetically modified to excel at physical task, but that genetic tampering was weakened their physique, making them frail and sickly.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Arkanian Offshoots have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Arkanian Offshoots have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** Arkanian Offshoots are typically engineered for specific industrial tasks. They gain the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/skill-focus.md|Skill Focus]] Feat for one of the following [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) in which they are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained): [Endurance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance), [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics), [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot), [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival), or [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury).
- **Determination:** Arkanian Offshoots are particularly determined and driven. Once per encounter, an Arkanian Offshoot can reroll one failed [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) with a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill). This reroll can be declared after the success or failure of the roll is known. The Arkanian Offshoot must take the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Arkanian Offshoots can speak, read, and write both Basic and Arkanian (albeit with a distinct accent).
