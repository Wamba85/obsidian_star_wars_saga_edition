*Kilmaulsi Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001 (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

Religious wars among rival tribes threatened to annihilate the Kilmaulsi eons ago. However, the wars ended abruptly when ships carrying [Vorzydiaks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vorzydiaks), [Paiguns](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Paiguns), and [Hrakians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hrakians) visited the Kilmauls System and established peaceful contact with the Kilmaulsi leaders. Smitten with the possibilities of space travel and offworld exploration, the Kilmaulsi ended their bitter rivalries. Many have since migrated offworld in search of fortune among the stars.

The war-forged Kilmaulsi relish contact with other peaceful [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). On their homeworld, wars of religion and ideals have taken a back seat to technological development and a widespread desire to explore the stars. Among the other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) native to the Vorzyd Cluster, Kilmaulsi are prized as warriors, transforming into terrifying blurs of color in battle.

Kilmaulsi are frequent sights throughout [The Commonality](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Commonality), generally serving as soldiers or manual labor. Kilmaulsi soldiers often wear ornate green armor similar in all technical aspects to [Battle Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Armor).
