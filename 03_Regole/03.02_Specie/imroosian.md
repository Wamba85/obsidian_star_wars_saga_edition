*Imroosian Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The Imroosians are an impoverished Species from the volcanic world of [Imroosia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imroosia). The frequent eruptions and groundquakes make permanent settlements nearly impossible, and what few towns can thrive have to compete for what little fertile land is left. This has caused many Imroosians to leave their home for the greater galaxy, using their keen intellect and deceptively tough bodies to make livings as information brokers and underworld bodyguards. More legitimate Imroosians might instead find work in law enforcement, or even in one of the many galactic bureaucracies.

Due to their dangerously dynamic homeworld, Imroosians attach little value to material possessions. As such, the galaxy's interest and investment to arts is baffling to most Imroosians.
### Imroosian Characteristics
**Personality:** Imroosians are often blunt and patient, largely lacking social graces but still capable of empathy. They are puzzled by the luxuries used by the greater galaxy, seeing little purpose in their use. Those few Imroosians that can do make connections become trusted confidants and would never betray their friends' trust.

**Physical Description:** Imroosians are thin humanoids with chalky-white skin. They have pointed ears and dark colored eyes, and their skin is segmented like tectonic plates. Their unique physiology lack sweat glands, making cooler environments lethargic to Imroosians. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Imroosians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-16 Years | 17-38 Years | 39-56 Years | 57-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Imroosians hail from the volcanic world of [Imroosia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imroosia), with eruptions so frequent that less than a quarter of the world is habitable.

**Languages:** The language of Imroosian uses soothing tones and is almost melodic in speaking. The written language uses elaborate pictograms, with each image conveying literal ideas.

**Example Names:** Agira, Kura, Margo, Mem, Ru-Ru.

**Adventurers:** Imroosians often leave the galaxy to escape the hostility of [Imroosia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imroosia), and use their keen insights and tough bodies as explorers and bodyguards. [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) most commonly suit Imroosians, as do [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). Force-using Imroosians are almost revered, as those that can use *[Plant Surge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Plant_Surge)* can prevent a village's starvation for a generation.
### Imroosian Species Traits
Imroosians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Imroosians receive a +2 bonus to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Imroosians are insightful and deceptively tough, but have difficulty relating to others.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Imroosians have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Imroosians have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Heat Resistance:** Imroosians add a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) to resist [Extreme Heat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Heat).
- **Low-Light Vision:** Imroosians ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (but not [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness.
- **Survival Instinct:** Imroosians have long since learned to take care of themselves. An Imroosian can reroll [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) checks, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Language:** All Imroosians can speak, read, and write both Basic and Imroosian.
