*Caarite Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Caarites are sly, ingratiating beings whose friendly demeanors overshadow their penchant for crooked dealings. While they suffer from a rather poor reputation, it is difficult for anyone around a Caarite for an extended period of time to believe it capable of anything truly malicious. They wear broad grins, bearing a double row of wide, flat, white teeth. Taking advantage of their frail, friendly appearance, they seize the upper hand in negotiations, exuding an almost childlike charm when dealing directly with large groups of individuals.
### Caarite Characteristics
**Personality:** Caarites are friendly, entertaining, and opportunistic. They desire to get the better of their rivals by any means necessary and demonstrate few scruples at the bargaining table.

**Physical Description:** Caarites stand 1 meter tall (on average), with features that are vaguely porcelain. They have slightly elongated snouts turned delicately upwards at their tips. Their broad, open faces make their open smiles look even friendlier. Their flesh is pale pink, and their bodies are hairless.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Caarites age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-15 Years | 16-44 Years | 45-57 Years | 58-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The humid [Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim) planet of [Caarimon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Caarimon).

**Languages:** Caarites speak Caarimala and Basic. Many Caarites know at least one additional language.

**Example Names:** Belrem Mar, Fiana Jor, Thurm Loogg, Velin Wir, Zoda Brell.

**Adventurers:** Caarites who become adventurers do so for personal gain. They favor nonviolent tactics when face-to-face with an adversary, but they nonetheless carry a number of tools and ranged weapons. Caarites favor the [Scoundrel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel) and [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) classes. Because they are adverse to physical combat, they do not take up the [Soldier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier) class. Some Caarites are Force-sensitive, but their inherent greed prevents them from following the path of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi).
