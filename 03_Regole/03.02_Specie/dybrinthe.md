*Dybrinthe Species data created by Wikia users SunsetMage001 and Droidscotty.*

The Dybrinthe are a clan society ordered in castes. Each clan controls its own territory which is sometimes the subject of internal struggles to appropriate the property of others.

Indeed, the primary resource of their homeworld [Dybrin 12](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dybrin_12), fuel, bubbles up in vast subterranean oceans and begs to be collected by vast mobile refinery cities. The rival clans then dig ever deeper underground tunnels in order to divert the precious fuel for their own profit.

### Dybrinthe Characteristics
**Personality:** Dybrinthe will be fiercely protective of their clan and obedient to clan structure (this may include shipmates and colleagues when offworld), and will freely steal from and sabotage those not of their clan.

**Physical Description:** Dybrinthe are bright-skinned beings possessing wide eyes and gilllike orifices.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Dybrinthe age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 Years | 6-16 Years | 17-35 Years | 36-50 Years | 51-70 Years | 71+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Deep Core moon of [Dybrin 12](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dybrin_12) is a harsh world, where it's rare to survive past adulthood.

**Language:** The Dybrinthe language is a curious form of Skakoverbal in combination with Bocce, with traces of mathematical formulas. Very difficult to master by anyone other than Dybrinthe or a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/skakoan.md|Skakoan]], it is not commonly practiced outside of their homeworld.

**Example Names:** Athgar Heece, Dijuka, Kuppic Lem.

**Adventurers:** Dybrinthes of lower castes often find success as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), or [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians), whereas higher caste Dybrinthe are taught from a young age as [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles).

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Dybrinthe receive a +2 bonus to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity).
