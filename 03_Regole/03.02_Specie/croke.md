*Croke Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

[The Sorcerers of Tund](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sorcerers_of_Tund) seem to include a variety of Species. In reality, most Sorcerers of Tund belong to a Species called the Croke, who possess the ability to cloak themselves in a powerful illusion. Croke are actually diminutive snaillike creatures, easily held in the hand of a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]. They make up for their small size with their mastery of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).

The Croke are a Species of sentient, multi-legged beings of extreme longevity; one individual enjoying a lifespan of more than 20,000 years. In their natural form, Croke resemble bristly-legged snails that were diminutive enough to be held in a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] hand. However, the Croke are naturally skilled in illusion casting, a Force ability that allows them to appear in larger guises.

### Croke Characteristics
**Personality:** Croke are known to have vicious personalities characterized by mean-spiritedness and blatant pursuit of personal ends. Croke compensate for their tiny size with their natural mastery of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) and the casting of illusions over their true form.

**Physical Description:** The Croke body resembles that of a snail or slug, with oily skin ranging in color from black to gray. A Croke creeps about on spindly, hairy, black legs; a single individual might sport as few as a dozen, or as many as several thousand such appendages. While wearing their Illusionary Form (see below), a Croke may hold the appearance of any Small or Medium sized [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Croke age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-14 Years | 15-99 Years | 100-9,999 Years | 10,000-14,999 Years | 15,000-19,999 Years | 20,000+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Croke evolved on [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions) planet of [Crakull](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Crakull), and colonized a larger area of [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions) known as the Croke Reach.

**Languages:** Croke speak a language also known as Croke, although individual Croke are capable of learning to read and write languages such as Basic, Sith, and Tundan as well. Some Croke swore hexes when vexed.

**Example Names:** Asenec, Firtha, Feak Motal, Rokur Gepta.

**Adventurers:** Some Croke leave the bounds of the Croke Reach and made their way into the known galaxy, using their natural abilities to their advantage so as to conceal their true form and pass unnoticed. Crokes' mastery over their Illusionary Forms makes them ideal [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigies), and to a lesser extent [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles).

### Croke Species Traits
Croke share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Croke suffer -6 penalty to the [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), and -4 penalties to both their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Croke are naturally shrewd and convincing, but their diminutive size makes them incapable of performing most physical tasks.
- **Diminutive Size:** As Diminutive creatures, Croke gain a +5 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +15 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are one quarter of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Croke have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Bonus Feat:** Croke receive the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat at 1st level as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Illusionary Form:** A Croke can hide its true appearance behind an illusion. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), a Croke can appear as a Small or Medium creature that can vary in appearance depending on who views it, and it can maintain this illusion indefinitely. The illusion has no effect on the Croke's statistics.
    - A creature can pierce the illusion by making a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check against the Croke's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), but only while the Croke is [Stunned](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stunned) or [Unconscious](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unconscious). The illusion otherwise looks and feels absolutely real.
- **Mental Resistance:** Croke gain a +1 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).
- **Unusual Physiology:** A Croke suffers a -5 penalty to any attack roll, skill check, or ability check when using [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) not designed for their [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
- **Vacuum Immunity:** Croke are immune to the effects of a [Vacuum](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vacuum).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Croke can speak, read, and write both Basic and Croke.
