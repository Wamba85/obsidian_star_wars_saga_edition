*Chevin Species data created by Sterling Hershey ([source](https://www.sterlinghershey.com/blog/2011/1/5/star-wars-wednesday-chevin-and-species-creation.html)).*

The Chevin are a migratory pachydermoid Species native to the planet [Vinsoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vinsoth). Chevin society remains primitive by galactic standards. Before Old Republic scouts and merchants made contact  with them, the Chevin lived in nomadic warrior clans. The pachydermoids took what they needed to survive from settlements of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chev.md|Chev]], a sapient [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) Species of farmers who have been under Chevin domination for the entire recorded histories of both Species. When visitors to [Vinsoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vinsoth) introduced advanced technology to the world, the Chevin adapted it to their society rather than conforming to what the visitors claimed was a better way to live. The Chevin also discovered the lucrative slave trade, and they started rounding up [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chev.md|Chev]] and selling them to interested offworlders.

[[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chev.md|Chev]] slaves and foodstuffs are the most common exports from [Vinsoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vinsoth). To obviate unrest among the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/chev.md|Chev]] slaves, Chevin take relatively good care of them and allow the [Chevs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevs) to preserve their cultural heritage.

Not surprisingly, the Chevin have carved a niche for themselves in the galactic criminal underworld, becoming known to the galaxy at large as a Species of smugglers, gun-runners, profiteers, gamblers, slavers, and blackmailers. Indeed, most Chevin that interact with the galaxy at large are involved in one or more of the above "Professions."

### Chevin Characteristics
**Personality:** Most Chevin are simple creatures interested only in acquiring money, power, and status. They use intrigue, manipulation of beings in places of authority, careful investments, and outright theft. They tend to stay clear of direct involvement with specific political factions or power groups, attempting at all times to deal with all who can pay for their services. While law-abiding beings try to avoid dealing with Chevin for fear of falling victim to some criminal scheme, more risk-prone individuals and criminals eagerly seek them out because Chevin are, in fact, honest in their business dealing in the underworld. A Chevin never double-crosses a business partner and expects to be dealt with honestly in return.

**Physical Description:** Chevin walk on two thick legs and have massive bodies that are as wide as they are tall. Their powerful arms end in large, three fingered hands. Their heads rest on curved necks that angle toward their ground and their heavily lidded eyes appear to be solid black and pupiless. Adult Chevin stand roughly 2 to 3 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Chevin age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

**Homeworld:** [Vinsoth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vinsoth), a temperate and verdant world located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim)- a world they share with the Near-Human [Chevs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chevs).

**Language:** Chevin speak and read Chevin, those who travel the galaxy also learn to speak Basic.
