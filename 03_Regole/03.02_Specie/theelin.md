*Theelin Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Theelin are [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) notable for their artistic talent, their colorful appearance, and their unfortunate physiological history. The original appearance of the Theelin is uncertain, as almost all known "Theelin" are not full-blooded specimens, but hybrids. It is possible that some aspects of these individuals' appearances were not from their Theelin genes, but from other [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] or [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) ancestors; the differences could also be related to the very mutations that were plaguing the Species.

A series of mutations arose among their Species during the last years of [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic) that led to genetic incompatibilities within their Species, making it impossible to produce offspring. Even attempts to continue the Species by cross-breeding with [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) and other [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) could not stop the slide towards extinction due to the high infant mortality rates from which such couplings suffered. Theelins inevitably dwindled in number- only a few million Theelin and Theelin hybrids remained by the time the Republic fell, and pure Theelin were extinct by the time of [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic). 

Some of their greatest works were produced in these years, however, as an epitaph for a dying people. Theelin performers and artists created many of The Galactic Republic's greatest works of art. The Theelin Divas, an all-female religious order, were recognized by many scholars of music as the greatest singers in the Galaxy. Because of the rarity of the Theelin, many female Theelin and part-Theelin are named "Diva" at birth, in hopes that they would develop the musical talent necessary to continue the traditions of the Diva Order. 

### Theelin Characteristics
**Personality:** The Theelin are artistic and charming, and are major contributors to the creative works of the galaxy. A dying race, Theelin are nonetheless good-humored and make good company.

**Physical Description:** Most Theelin have vividly colored hair and pale skin, sometimes with purple or reddish tones, and often mottled with colorful spots. Due to their great genetic variations, there are few other defining characteristics of the Theelin. On average a Theelin stands 1.6 meters tall, just slightly shorter than baseline [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Theelin age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-16 Years | 17-39 Years | 40-54 Years | 55-69 Years | 70+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Due to the muddled history of the Theelin, is is unclear where they originated from, as they now reside on innumerable habitable worlds in Republic Space.

**Languages:** The Theelin have completely integrated themselves into galactic society, and use Basic as their primary language. At a young age, many Theelin also learn Bocce to communicate with others in trade.

**Example Names:** Chass Chadic, Diva Funquita, Latts Razzi, Rystáll Sant, Gooti Terez.

**Adventurers:** Theelin frequently venture out into the galaxy, experiencing a insatiable sense of wanderlust their entire lives. They most frequently use their skills as [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), but Theelin [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) are also common. Theelin Force-users are infrequent, but not unheard of.
