*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Wookiees are widely recognized as one of the strongest and fiercest intelligent [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) in the galaxy. Wookiees have many customs and traditions that revolve around honor and loyalty, including the special bond called the honor family and the sacred pledge called the Life Debt. A Wookiee never uses his or her climbing claws in combat; doing this is considered dishonorable and a sign of madness.
### Wookiee Characteristics
**Personality:** Wookiees tend to be honorable, rash, loyal, and short-tempered.

**Physical Description:** Wookiees are large furry bipeds, ranging in height from 2 to 2.3 meters.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Wookiee male stands at 2.2 meters tall and weighs 125 kilograms, while a typical Wookiee female stands at 2.0 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Wookiees age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

**Homeworld:** The forest world of [Kashyyyk](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyyyk).

**Languages:** Wookiees speak Shyriiwook, consisting of complex grunts and growls. They understand Basic but lack the ability to speak it.

**Example Names:** Chewbacca, Gorwooken, Groznik, Lowbacca, Ralrra, Rorworr, Salporin.

**Adventurers:** Wookiee adventurers usually start out as wanderers or explorers as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), but some find this path by forming an honor family with (or owning a Life Debt to) other adventurers.
### Wookiee Species Traits
Wookiees share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Wookiees receive a +4 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), and +2 bonus to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Wookiees are powerful and hardy, but they aren't agile, tend to be impulsive, and have little patience for diplomacy.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Wookiees have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Wookiees have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Expert Climber:** Wookiees are great climbers and may choose to [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on [Climb](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climb) checks, even when distracted or threatened.
- **Extraordinary Recuperation:** A Wookiee regains Hit Points at double the normal rate (see [Natural Healing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Natural_Healing)).
- **Intimidating Presence:** Known to pull off the ears of [Gundarks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gundarks), Wookiees may choose to reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) others, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Rage:** Once per day, a Wookiee can fly into a Rage as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). While Raging, the Wookiee temporarily gains a +2 Rage bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls, but cannot use [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) that require patience and concentration, such as [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics), [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth), or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force). A fit of Rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the Wookiee's [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
    - At the end of its Rage, the Wookiee moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). The penalties imposed by this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) persist until the Wookiee takes at least 10 minutes to recuperate, during which time the Wookiee can't engage in any strenuous activity.
- **Weapon Familiarity ([Bowcaster](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bowcaster) and [Ryyk Blade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ryyk_Blade)):** Wookiees treat the [Bowcaster](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bowcaster) as a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle) instead of an [Exotic Weapon (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Ranged)). They additionally treat the [Ryyk Blade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ryyk_Blade) as an [Advanced Melee Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapon) instead of an [Exotic Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Melee)).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Wookiees can speak Shyriiwook and understand Basic.
