A specially bred offshoot of [Zolanders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zolanders), Clawdites were genetically engineered to withstand the unsafe levels of [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation) generated by an unstable sun. However, Clawdites developed an unexpected mutation- the ability to shapechange. The [Zolanders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zolanders) deemed the Clawdites a dire threat- a devious subspecies filled with wickedness. Therefore, to guard against Clawdite treachery, the [Zolanders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zolanders) sequester them in wretched ghettos, where they live as second-class citizens under the watchful eyes of their captors.

The Clawdites chafe under the tyrannical yoke placed upon them, and those who can, flee, but more languish on their homeworld, struggling to find some way to be free. Count Dooku and the Separatist Movement offered the Clawdites the freedom they craved from the [Zolanders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zolanders), so many enlisted to support Count Dooku's war effort in exchange for his promise. The aid was short lived, for the Separatist Movement unraveled with Count Dooku's death.

Only after the fall of the Empire did the Clawdites finally rise up against the [Zolanders](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zolanders), fighting a brutal civil war that consumed the world in violence. The Clawdites eventually gained control of the planet, and in victory, they assert themselves as the dominant Species. Free, the Clawdites courted the New Republic, and threw their support behind Alliance Intelligence organizations, using their unique talents to infiltrate the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]], and sabotaged equipment, gathered intelligence, and assassinated critical targets. The Clawdites took on this dangerous work because they are driven to support the cause of liberty, and for them, the end always justifies the means.

### Clawdite Characteristics
**Personality:** Clawdites are staunchly committed to freedom and detest opposition in all its forms. Independent spirits, they go their own way, following their hearts rather than abide by a set of rules imposed on them. Above all, Clawdites hate bigotry and prejudice, and do not tolerate bullies. The more violent Clawdites are sure to make examples of those they encounter.

**Physical Description:** In their natural forms, Clawdites are distinctly reptilian, their thick hides having a green or ochre cast. Their catlike eyes are yellow, set in a face that could pass for [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]. Clawdites can alter their appearance in subtle ways when young, and as they age and practice their skills, they can assume the appearance of similarly sized [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), even masking their equipment when it is held close to their bodies. 

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Clawdite male stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs 65 kilograms, while a typical Clawdite female stands at 1.6 meters tall and weighs 55 kilograms.
