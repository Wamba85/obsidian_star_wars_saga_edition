*Kushiban Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Kushibans are often mistaken for pets or vermin, when in fact they are an intelligent race with a complex, peaceful society.Kushibans have little need for tools or technology on their homeworld, where they manage to live in almost complete harmony with their natural environment. Although preyed upon by large predators, Kushibans typically use fire to keep them at bay. As herbivores, they do not need tools for hunting or preparing food. As they eat most of their food uncooked, they have little use for cooking utensils or similar items. When Kushibans need shelter from the elements, simple caves or tree hollows suffice. Consequently, Kushibans have little value to a spacefaring economy, and little desire to leave their homeworld.

Kushibans have a unique method of expressing their feelings: Their normally white fur changes color with their emotional state. This "Mood Fur" can go completely black when the creature is in deep despair.

### Kushiban Characteristics
**Personality:** Kushibans are generous, gentle beings with a playful (Usually wry) sense of humor. However, they can be vindictive and downright vicious when angered or betrayed. They have a low tolerance for bullies, simpletons, and misanthropes.

**Physical Description:** Kushibans are 0.5-meter-long lagomorphic creatures with soft white fur, floppy ears, front paws that can be used as hands, small keen noses, and large, innocent-looking eyes. They can move as either quadrupeds or bipeds, though they must drop to all fours to [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) or [Run](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Run).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Kushibans age at the following stages:
