*Zandor Rocker Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The Zandor Rockers are a Species of sentient beings who look like rocks with legs and faces. Like other sentient beings, Zandor Rockers feel pain and maintain a strict sense of empathy for those around them. They can use their entire body as a weapon against larger creatures, simply by jumping on their enemy with their full weight proves to be quite painful to the target.

Zandor Rockers live in the barren deserts of [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor). There, they live in harmony with the region's sunnydew flowers, plants that created sunnydew nectar and sustained their growth alongside of the rest of the region's plant life. After an altercation sees them ally with traveling [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) against Gantu the Ogre, Zandor Rockers take a much more active, if still minor, role in the [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes).
