Intelligent omnivores native to one of the moons orbiting [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), Ewoks are almost unknown prior to the battle of Endor. Ewoks live in tree-dwelling tribes with gender-based division of labor; males hunt, forage, and make weapons, while females raise young and handle other domestic tasks. Ewok culture revolves around complex animistic beliefs involving the giant trees of the forest moon.

Although technologically primitive, Ewoks are clever, inquisitive, and inventive. Skittish and wary when first introduced to machines, their curiosity soon overcomes fear.

### Ewok Characteristics
**Personality:** Ewoks tend to be curious, superstitious, and courageous, though they can be fearful around things that are strange or new.

**Physical Description:** Ewoks average about 1 meter tall. Their fur color and pattern varies widely.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Ewok stands at 1.0 meters tall and weighs 30 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ewoks age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-14 Years | 14-29 Years | 30-44 Years | 45-59 Years | 60+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor).

**Languages:** Ewoks speak Ewokese. They have no written form of their language. They can learn to speak Basic.

**Example Names:** Asha, Chirpa, Deej, Kneesaa, Latara, Logray, Malani, Nippet, Paploo, Shodu, Teebo, Wicket, Wiley.

**Adventurers:** An Ewok adventurer may be motivated by a love of excitement, a natural inquisitiveness, or a warrior's quest. Collecting powerful "Magic" items from fallen opponents is a sure way to earn the respect of the tribe.

### Ewok Species Traits
Ewoks share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Ewoks receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). Ewoks are very agile but somewhat weak.
