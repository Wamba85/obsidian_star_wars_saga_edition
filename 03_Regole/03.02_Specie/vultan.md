Vultans are a technologically advanced [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) Species native to the planet [Vulta](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vulta), located at the spinward edge of [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim). The Vultan culture was already five millennia old at the time of the Great Hyperspace War. As citizens of an old and curious culture, Vultans tend to go through waves of fads and technological growth. Many Old Republic corporations have a few Vultans on their board of directors. 

Even during the time of the Empire, Vultans commonly worked as programmers for holovid entertainment companies. Vultans seem quick to adapt any new lifestyle idea that comes along, regardless of its usefulness.
