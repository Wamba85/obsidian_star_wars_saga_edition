*Moldwarp Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Moldwarps are a wealthy species of somewhat mole-like beings. They have a reputation as polite nobility who take care to keep up with the manners and fashions of high society, but also as ruthless profit-seekers and racketeers. This sharp juxtaposition of roles often has Moldwarps come across as spontaneous and random, but most Moldwarps instead consider this a product of their learned nature and "high class."
### Moldwarp Characteristics
**Personality:** Moldwarps typically come across as charming and refined, but they are also often reckless and prone to getting in situations over their heads.

**Physical Description:** Moldwarps are warm-blooded bipedal creatures with large mouths and flat noses. Moldwarps are accustomed to living underground on their homeworld, and as such require specialised goggles to protect their eyes on most worlds.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Moldwarps age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-40 Years | 41-59 Years | 60-100 Years | 101+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Lespectus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lespectus), a planet in the [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds), situated on the Trellen Trade Route.

**Language:** Moldwarps are accustomed to life in the high society of [The Core](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Core) and are raised with the refined dialect of High Galactic.

### Moldwarp Species Traits
Moldwarps share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Moldwarps receive a +2 bonus to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Moldwarps are adept charmers and swindlers, but are lacking in both eyesight and foresight.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Moldwarps have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Moldwarps have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** Moldwarps have mastered the art of the scam. A Moldwarp with [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Deception)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Deception)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Darkvision:** Moldwarps ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (including [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness. However, they cannot perceive colors in total darkness.
- **Expert Climber:** Moldwarps are adept at climbing in their underground homes. A Moldwarp may choose to [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on [Climb](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climb) checks even when distracted or threatened.
- **Special Equipment:** Moldwarps' eyes are accustomed to dark, claustrophobic underground tunnels. When exposed to sudden light, and without protective goggles, a Moldwarp moves -2 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) steps down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). This [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) can only be removed after spending one hour in darkness, or one hour after putting on protective goggles.
    - Replacement goggles cost 1,000 credits (200 on [Lespectus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lespectus)). Moldwarp characters begin play with a pair of protective goggles at no cost.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Moldwarps can speak, read, and write High Galactic.
