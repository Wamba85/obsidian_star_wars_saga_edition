*Huralok Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001 (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

Huraloks are a reptilian species known for their viciousness, vast capacity for grudges, and extremely long lives. They accept their foul reputation in the galaxy and generally remain hidden away, leaving dealings with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to their minions when at all possible. The Imperial Navy's running battles with Huralok pirates have long been popular fare for holodramas.
### Huralok Characteristics
**Personality:** Ruthless, opportunistic, and horribly vindictive bullies, Huraloks possess few (if any) scruples or virtues. They are master manipulators that love nothing better than weaving webs of deceit and misdirection to ensnare the unwary. Fortunately for the galaxy, they also loathe their own kind, coming together only to mate and in times of grave danger for their Species.

**Physical Description:** Huraloks are reptilian bipeds with triangular heads, widespread eyes, and stocky physiques. Black stripes adorn their scaly hides. A typical Huralok adult stands 1.5 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Huraloks age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-15 Years | 16-44 Years | 45-120 Years | 121-240 Years | 241-330 Years | 331+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The volcanic Mid Rim world of [Djurmo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Djurmo).

**Languages:** Huraloks read, write, and speak their own language (Huralok). Most also learn to speak Basic.

**Example Names:** Ergihl Threk, Fehkla Gorr, Krad Dokahr, Liirk Ranguhl, Redkihl Rokk.

**Adventurers:** Huralok adventurers are rare and tend to be self-serving [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). Although they can be Force-sensitive, Huraloks lack the dedication and selfless nature necessary to join the ranks of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi).
### Huralok Species Traits
Huraloks share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** Huraloks have no [Ability Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_Score) adjustments.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Huraloks have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Huraloks have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** Huraloks are solitary beings, and often rely mostly on swarms of Droids as their allies. A Huralok with [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/expert-droid-repair.md|Expert Droid Repair]] as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Intimidating Presence:** A Huralok may choose to reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) others, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Natural Weapons:** A Huralok has Natural Weapons, in the form of razor-sharp claws. When a Huralok makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Huraloks are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Huraloks can speak, read, and write Huralok.
