*Sith Offshoot Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Sith Offshoots, or more commonly referred to as Sith Purebloods or simply Sith, are the descendants of the original Sith Species. A Species of red-skinned Humanoids strong in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), Sith Offshoots came to be after Sith intermingled with [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] exiles almost seven thousand years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin).

Despite a society dominated by barbarism and infighting, Sith civilization culminated in a Golden Age, after which the Species all but scattered across the galaxy. An eponymous Dark Side tradition took the Species' name. [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith), despite numerous manifestations over time, maintained foundations borne of the customs, science and magic practiced by the ancient Sith, and their current Sith Offshoot progeny.
### Sith Offshoot Characteristics
**Personality:** For Sith Offshoots, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Their social order is very rigid, and a caste system divides the populace into engineers, warriors, and priests (who would later form the subspecies of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/zuguruk.md|Zuguruk]], [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]], and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/kissai.md|Kissai]], respectively).

**Physical Description:** Adult Sith Offshoots characteristically had skin of a crimson-hue, although some members of the Species have more pink shades of skin tone. Sith Offshoots inherited sharp, fierce predatory profiles and features all over their bodies, including bone spurs protruding from under their skin at various locations like the elbows. Their faces display a notable pair of cheek tendrils that hang down from their high cheekbones.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Sith Offshoots age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-16 Years | 17-34 Years | 35-49 Years | 50-69 Years | 70+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The precursor Sith Species originated on [Korriban](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban), and Sith Offshoots would live there for several generations before resettling on [Dromund Kaas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dromund_Kaas), and more prominently [Ziost](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ziost).

**Languages:** Sith Offshoots practice an ancient version of the Sith language, often with distinct accents that vary from planet to planet.

**Example Names:** Miarta Sek, Ffon Althe, Karnak Tetsu, Ravilan Wroth, Vodal Kressh.

**Adventurers:** Sith Offshoots often leave their home to create their own legacy, gaining power and knowledge to be forever cemented into history. While Sith Offshoot [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) aren't all that uncommon, Sith Offshoots consistently choose the path of [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) as members of [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith) or [The Believers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Believers).
