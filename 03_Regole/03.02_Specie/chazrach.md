*Chazrach Species data created by wizards forum user Darth_Scorpion.*

The shock troopers of [The Yuuzhan Vong Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Yuuzhan_Vong_Empire), the Chazrach are a reptilian Species known to [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) only as "Reptoids." Bred for untold generations as slaves, Chazrach learn to wield [Amphistaffs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaffs) and stay in rough squads. While not as formidable as [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] of the warrior caste, Chazrach tend to be single minded and incapable of surrender.

### Chazrach Characteristics
**Personality:** The Chazrach are warriors, serving the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] single-mindedly. They were long ago conquered by the extragalactic Species, as have since served as their mindless shock troopers and cannon fodder.

**Physical Description:** Chazrach are reptilian in appearance, with scaly hides and inset eyes. They average 1.9 meters in height, with green scales and eyes ranging between yellow and orange.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Chazrach age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-12 Years | 13-34 Years | 35-44 Years | 55-59 Years | 60+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Whatever planet the Chazrach originally hailed from is lost to the ages, and they now serve the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] at [Zonama Sekot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zonama_Sekot).

**Languages:** Chazrach learn to speak Yuuzhan Vong, but most lack the ability to become literate.

**Example Names:** None, Chazrach lack individual names, instead relying on assigned designations for organization.

**Adventurers:** Chazrach adventurers are unheard of. Their lack of will and inbred sense of loyalty makes them [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) cannon fodder. Aged Chazrach warriors might become [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), but these rare few typically don't last.
