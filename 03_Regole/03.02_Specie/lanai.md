*Lanai Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

The Lanai evolved from the same evolutionary stock of seabirds that produced the unintelligent [Porgs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Porg). They have been the guardians of the ancient [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) temple planet of [Ahch-To](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ahch-To) for thousands of years. The female Caretakers watch over the sacred Temple Island and maintain its ancient structures and relics, while the male Visitors spend most of their time at sea, returning for monthly celebrations. 

Lanai technology is solely derived from fish; useful skins and skeletons are gathered from the oceans, which the Lanai use to make their tools and furnishings.
### Lanai Characteristics
**Personality:** Lanai culture is highly musical, with work songs being common during day-to-day chores. They are often annoyed by outside visitors, considering them to be a disruption to their tasks and routines.

**Physical Description:** Lanai are short, fish-like beings with thin, avian legs. The natural oils of their skin, hair, and plumage have an innate water-shedding ability, allowing them to withstand intense conditions of their oceanic planet. They possess salt glands that assist in the extraction of sea salt from their sustenance, as well as membranes which close over their eyes, enabling sharp underwater vision.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Lanai age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-19 Years | 20-149 Years | 150-299 Years | 300-399 Years | 400+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Lanai evolved on the island-studded ocean world of [Ahch-To](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ahch-To).

**Language:** The Lanai lanugage is a combination of spoken words and hand motions. Their written language consists of cuneiform marks based on the shape of their feet, but it is rarely used, with fire signals being preferred for long-range communications.

**Example Names:** Alcida-Auka, Auk-Waimanu, Corm-Kairuku, Grebe-Korora, Hesper-Inguza, Terna-Gentu. 

**Adventurers:** Lanai Caretakers are typically [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), while Visitors are typically [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). Lanai that leave their homeworld usually diverge considerably from this however, often becoming [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi). 
### Lanai Species Traits
Lanai share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Lanai receive a +2 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). The Lanai are well adapted to life on their remote planet, but their spindly limbs limit their physical strength.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Lanai gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.

- **Bonus Class Skill:** [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) is always a Class Skill for a Lanai.

- **Expert Swimmer:** A Lanai may choose to reroll any [Swim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swim) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse. In addition, a Lanai may choose to [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on [Swim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swim) checks even when distracted or threatened.
- **Hold Breath:** Lanai are at home either in air or in water. A Lanai can hold his or her breath for a number of rounds equal to 25 times their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) score before they need to make [Endurance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance) checks to hold their breath.
