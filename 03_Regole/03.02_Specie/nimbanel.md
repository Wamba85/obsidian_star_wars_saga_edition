*Nimbanel Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Nimbanels (or Nimbanese) are a Species of warm-blooded humanoid reptiles known for their adoration of complex mathematics and intricate bureaucracies. They use figures to winefully convolute and obscure meaning and prefer to resolve conflict by befuddling their opponents with official procedures, puzzling rules, and administrative blockades.

Nimbanels put their organizational talents to work serving major business concerns, like [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics), [The Corporate Sector Authority](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Corporate_Sector_Authority), and [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire). Through the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts), many Nimbanels have secured prominent administrative positions in the galaxy and preserved their way of life.

Although most Nimbanels serve the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) as willing slaves, a few Nimbanels are free to make their own way in the galaxy, often after years of dedicated service to their masters, They build large networks of business contacts and quickly earn reputations as fussy entrepreneurs- obsessed with form and procedure- but they invariably get the job done in an efficient manner, even if they inconvenience others along the way.
