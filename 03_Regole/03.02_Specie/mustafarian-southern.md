Hailing from the volcanic world of [Mustafar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mustafar), the inhabitants of this world bear a striking resemblance to the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/kubaz.md|Kubaz]], with long trunks and sloping foreheads dominating their faces. Although the planet is barely habitable, life always seems to find a way, and life forms were soon living on cooled portions of the lava floe. There are two separate and distinct races of Mustafarian: the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/mustafarian-northern.md|Northerners]], who are tall and thin, and the shorter, tougher Southerners. Despite their differences, none of the Mustafarians care much for matters offworld, or even the activities of foreigners on their own planet. They instead prefer to keep to themselves deep within their underground network of caves and warrens, living their own lives.

**Physical Description:** The Southern Mustafarians are squat, standing approximately 1.6 to 1.8 meters tall, and carry a much broader build. Both races of insectoids have dark gray skin, long trunks for noses, and foreheads that slope steeply towards their necks.
