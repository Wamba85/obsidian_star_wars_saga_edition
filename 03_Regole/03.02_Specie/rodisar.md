*Rodisar Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Rodisars are a crocodylomorph species from the planet [Rodis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rodis). Their planet was embroiled in a conflict known as the Winter Wars shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars. While they are somewhat proficient in combat, the ranks of their elite warriors and generals have a tendency for producing paper tigers.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Rodisars age at the following stages:
