*Lucksprite Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Lucksprites are a Species of small sentients found on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor). According to folklore of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), Lucksprites are responsible for the good and ill fortune of every being on the Forest Moon. In practice, a Lucksprite can project blasts of iridescent energy, which causes its targets to be afflicted by both extremes of chance. The impish creatures are whimsically split on just which type of luck is better, good or bad, frequently to the determinant of bystanders. Lucksprites take great pleasure in using their chance-changing abilities, but have a lack of restraint that leads to the ire of more aggressive natives such as [Duloks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Duloks) or [Skandits](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skandits).

### Lucksprite Characteristics
**Personality:** Lucksprites take great pride in their luck-based powers, bestowing luck at the request of particular patrons. Should a Lucksprite's target overcome the weal or woe bestowed upon them- succeeding in a task that the Lucksprite attempted to curse, for example- they can grow despondent at their perceived failure.

**Physical Description:** Lucksprites are greenish humanoid in appearance, with proportionally large heads and drooping features. Growing from a Lucksprite's head is a tentacular appendage used to fire bolts of good or bad luck.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Lucksprites age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-17 Years | 18-39 Years | 40-54 Years | 55-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Lucksprites live in small villages in the overgrown forests of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

**Languages:** Lucksprites have largely adopted Ewokese as their primary language, granting them the patronage of the largest single community on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

**Example Names:** Adversity, Auspicion, Mischance, Prosperity.

**Adventurers:** Lucksprites often work for individuals of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), taking great pride in their work. Often [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) to stalk their targets in secret, a handful of [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) Lucksprites are only slightly less common. Lucksprite [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are incredibly rare.
### Lucksprite Species Traits
Lucksprites share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Lucksprites receive a +2 bonus toÂ their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Lucksprites can be gregarious to their allies, but can lack self-control over their abilities.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Lucksprites gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Lucksprites have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Luck Blast:** Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a Lucksprite can designate a single creature within 6 squares and their line of sight. That creature must reroll their next skill check or attack roll, keeping the better or worse result (chosen by the Lucksprite when activating this ability).
- **Primitive:** Lucksprites do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Lucksprites can speak Ewokese. They have no written form of their language.
