*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

Sljee are low, slab-shaped, multi-tentacled aliens from the planet [Sljee](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sljee_(Planet)). While vision is the prime sense of most [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), the Sljee rely on their sense of smell; they have several antennae called olfactory stalks.

Sljee have had a great deal of trouble integrating into galactic society since they cannot distinguish different beings- they even have trouble distinguishing different [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). Their olfactory stalks are geared to a very specific range of scents, focusing around identifying other Sljee and food sources from their world. The unfamiliar scents of strange planets and beings that are totally alien to them is overwhelming for Sljee.
### Sljee Characteristics
**Personality:** Sljee are attentive and curious aliens, often bewildered by the strange smells to be found off their homeworld. As a communal Species, they often live in groups when away from their homeworld.

**Physical Description:** A Sljee is easily mistaken for a bizarre animal or some form of motile plant. They look like short gray tables topped with tentacles and bulbs, moving on a set of squat, stumpy legs.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Sljee age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-13 Years | 14-19 Years | 20-69 Years | 70-94 Years | 95-122 Years | 123+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Sljee](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sljee_(Planet)) is a world where species live by scent; being able to track creatures is the key to successful hunting and being able to disguise one's scent is the key to survival.

**Languages:** Sljee have developed a number of technologies, including naturally, scnet-based communication. Other Species are incapable of communicating or understanding Sljee.

**Example Names:** Bitoob, Jeseej, Kodouk, Techeit.

**Adventurers:** Sljee rarely leave [Sljee](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sljee_(Planet)), finding the wider galaxy confusing and uncomfortable. The rare few that do are typically [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), though Force-using Sljee also find great success.
