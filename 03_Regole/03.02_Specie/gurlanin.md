*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Species*

The Gurlanin of [Qiilura](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Qiilura) were content to live a fairly primitive lifestyle, happy in their simple lives. When Republic settlers came to their world to harvest barq, a delicacy, the Gurlanin were removed from some lands, and considered non-sentient pests by the mostly [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] settlers. When the Clone Wars began, the Separatists used the planet to house a biological weapons laboratory. Seeing an opportunity to make an ally that would help them reclaim their world, the Gurlanin allied with the Republic. Together, they were eventually able to remove not only the Separatists, but the Republic farmers as well. 

Gurlanin are marsupials, carrying their young in a pouch. They mate for life and are extremely loyal to their spouses. There is no known formal government amongst the Gurlanin, and each mated pair would seem to be considered a sovereign entity amongst fellow Gurlanin. The entire campaign against the Separatists and alliance with the Republic was engineered by a single pair of Gurlanin. When the brokered alliance looked as though it might fall apart, many other Gurlanin couples agreed to aid Jinart and Valaquil in potential reprisals, the threat of which caused the Republic to eventually keep its end of the bargain. 

### Gurlanin Characteristics

The Gurlanin are noted as having some of the most pleasant, soothing voices in the galaxy, lending aid to their attempts at persuasion and deception. 

**Physical Description:** In their natural form, Gurlanin are large, fourlegged canines with coarse black fur and no noticeable ears. Their mouths have a number of sharp, lethal fangs used for hunting small mammals on [Qiilura](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Qiilura). However, Gurlanin are meta-morphs, and can change shape at will, often appearing as whatever is necessary to achieve their goals.
