*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Species Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Species_Sourcebook)*
The Lepi are an omnivorous humanoid Species resembling anthropomorphic rabbits. They possess a heightened metabolism such that they are always in motion, giving some an air of fidgetiness. The Lepi enjoy a high reproductive rate. A mother Lepi will have up to three dozen offspring in her lifespan, and the Lepi mature sexually at the age of 10 standard years.

Lepi developed and pursued interstellar travel in response to overcrowding on their homeworld of [Coachelle Prime](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coachelle_Prime), though the Coachelle System seems to have provided enough space for the Species. They live in vast warrens beneath the surface of their homeworld and have colonized all the planets of their system, including much of the asteroid belt.
