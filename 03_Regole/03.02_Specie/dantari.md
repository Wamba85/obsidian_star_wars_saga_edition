The primitive natives of [Dantooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dantooine) are called Dantari, tribal humanoids that lead a nomadic life along the ocean coasts of the planet. The Dantari fashion simple clothing from the skins of local animals and crude weapons out of sticks and stones.

The Dantari are so few that [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), like the Empire and the Republic before it, considers [Dantooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dantooine) an uninhabited world- though [Dantooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dantooine) has been colonized at least twice in the past. Jedi Master Vodo-Siosk Baas settled there four thousand years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), and refugees from the volcanic world of [Eol Sha](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eol_Sha) made a new home on [Dantooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dantooine) seven years after Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). In between, before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), [Dantooine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dantooine) served as a base for [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance).

The settlers from [Eol Sha](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eol_Sha) met an unfortunate end, utterly wiped out by Admiral Daala, the Imperial commander in charge of the Maw Cluster installation near [Kessel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kessel). Curiously, the arrival of Daala's forces was an event of unprecedented awe to the primitive Dantari, who began incorporating Imperial symbology into their own belief system. The Dantari tattooed themselves with crude images of Imperial crests, [AT-ATs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/AT-ATs), blaster rifles, and in the case of the truly brave, full-body depictions of Stormtrooper armor. The best warriors have weapons fashioned from bits of metal scavenged from damaged [Imperial Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Vehicles), or perhaps from the ruins of the [Eol Sha](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eol_Sha) colony.

As primitives, Dantari are unskilled with technological itens.
