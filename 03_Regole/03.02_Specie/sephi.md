*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Edition Infinities Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Edition_Infinities_Campaign_Guide)*

A Species native to [Thustra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thustra), the Sephi are outwardly similar to [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) except for a thick spiral of hair-like matter that grows from the crown of their skulls. Proud Sephi adorn their spirals with gemstones and other baubles. The Sephi are a long-lasting Species, with some living for more than 200 years.

Following the death of King Alaric by Jedi Master Yoda, the Sephi people rally behind the Confederacy, seeing the Senate as an unjust tyranny. They join other systems in the Confederate Senate on [Raxus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Raxus).

### Sephi Characteristics
**Personality:** The Sephi live a monarchical society, and have developed a culture of elegance and sophistication in art, which is reflected in the delicate designs of their architecture and ships.

**Physical Description:** Outwardly, Sephi are very similar in appearance to [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), the key difference being their long, pointed ears. While many Sephi have pale, purplish skin, some possess more [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]]-like skintones. Their eyes come shades of black or brown. A Sephi's long, straight hair ranges in color from black through blond, and from gray to white.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Sephi age at the following stages:

**Languages:** Sephi speak their own native tongue, largely consisting of long vowels and hard consonants. A Sephi also learns Basic at a young age.

**Example Names:** Alaric, Dekluun, Lirka, Mala Mala, Moje, Navi, Sirka.

**Adventurers:** Sephi are often driven act whenever they feel they must. Whether this be something as simple as helping another in need, to their choice to support the Confederacy. Most Sephi fit into the roles of a [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) or [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) (although almost never as part of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi)).Â 

### Sephi Species Traits
Sephi share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Sephi receive a +2 bonus to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Sephi are elegant and cheerful, but their smaller frames reduce their physical abilities.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Sephi have no special bonuses or penalties due to size.
- **Speed:** Sephi have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bonus Trained Skill:** A Sephi's lifestyle allows numerous opportunities for personal growth. A Sephi character chooses one additional [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) at 1st level. The [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) must be chosen from the character's list of Class Skills.
- **Heightened Agility:** A Sephi's spindly body allows them to perform unusual stunts. A Sephi can choose to reroll any [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Sephi can speak, read, and write both Basic and Sephi.
