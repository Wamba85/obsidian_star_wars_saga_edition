*Sauvax Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Sauvax are amphibious crustaceans who inhabit the coastal regions of [Leritor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Leritor), growing and hunting food and building villages along the crags, tidal pools, and beaches. On land, they propel themselves on six spindly, segmented legs; in water, they swim using their underbelly bristles and twin, rudderlike tails.

Sauvax fashion their own dwellings and tools for daily life, though their civilization is quite primitive. They most commonly carry a multipurpose spear (called a Gruush in their own language). They use it to hunt fish in the waters of the continental shelf and cultivate various crops of seaweed and slime in tidal pools. Sauvax live in tribal villages called Kuuvan (a term that also means "Tribe"), consisting of structures made from stone and buttressed with sand and deadwood. Outsiders understand little of their society and culture since settlers rarely encounter them.
### Sauvax Characteristics
**Personality:** Most offworlders who encounter Sauvax view them as brusque, pushy, and intent on pursuing their business with minimum fuss. Sauvax generally keep to themselves but can be fierce when threatened. 

**Physical Description:** A flexible, chitinous shell covers the bulk of a Sauvax's head and torso. Their extruding eyes allow for greater visibility, and two delicate antennae augment their senses. Their bulky arms seem awkward above ground and serve as formidable weapons- on each hand, two massive digits (One opposed) form an oversized pincer claw, while three smaller digits (One opposed) enable finer manipulation. Adult Sauvax stand 1.5 to 1.8 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Sauvax age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 Years | 6-9 Years | 10-44 Years | 45-69 Years | 70-89 Years | 90+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Leritor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Leritor), a mineral-rich but otherwise unremarkable planet located near Bothan Space in [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim).

**Languages:** Sauvax mouths can formulate most sounds necessary for language. They speak their own tongue, but through infrequent contact with settlers have picked up a minimal understanding of Basic.

**Example Names:** Chuuvus, Gurruul, Juuesuur, Kruuvum, Muurbux, Tchuul, Uukk, Vrujuun.

**Adventurers:** Sauvax adventurers are usually [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), although those that become skilled in the use of modern weapons can become formidable [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). No Sauvax Force-users have ever been encountered.
### Sauvax Species Traits
Sauvax share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Sauvax receive a +2 bonus to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Sauvax are tough and mighty, but have difficulty with delicate tasks and rarely interact with others.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Sauvax have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Sauvax have a base speed of 6 squares. They also have a swim speed of 4 squares.
- **Breathe Underwater:** As amphibious creatures, Sauvax can't drown in water.
- **Expert Swimmer:** A Sauvax may choose to reroll any [Swim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swim) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse. In addition, a Sauvax may choose to [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on [Swim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swim) checks, even when distracted or threatened.

When a Sauvax makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of Slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Sauvax are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
