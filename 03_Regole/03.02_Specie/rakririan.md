*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

Rakririans are sentient arthropods indigenous to the planet [Rakrir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rakrir). Rakririan society has developed into being highly refined and cultured, seen by other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) as excessively finicky and meticulous. As a result of this, few Rakririans leave their homeworld, failing to find sufficiently sophisticated locations in the wider galaxy.
### Rakririan Characteristics
**Personality:** Rakririans have a highly developed sense of culture and refinement and bring new meaning to the words "meticulous" and "finicky."

**Physical Description:** Rakririans are many segmented aliens with tubular bodies, five sets of limbs and a pair of incessantly moving eyestalks.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Rakririans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-19 Years | 20-89 Years | 90-114 Years | 115-139 Years | 140+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Few Rakririans leave [Rakrir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rakrir) because there are virtually no other locations in the galaxy refined enough for them.

**Languages:** Rakririan is an intricate language, with an excessive number of different variations for different meanings and interpretations to properly communicate the proper taste of Rakririans.

**Example Names:** Endrigorn, Mogoyu, Sabodor.

**Adventurers:** Those Rakririans that leave [Rakrir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rakrir) tend to be fabulously wealthy or work in the service industries severing the wealthy. As such, [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) tends to be the primary role of Rakririans.
