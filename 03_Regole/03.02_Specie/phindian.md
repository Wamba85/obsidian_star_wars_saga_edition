Phindians are technologically advanced sentients known for creating a variety of technical wonders, including devices capable of erasing one's memory.

Before the rise of the Empire, a criminal organization called The Syndicat ruled the Phindian homeworld. The Phindian leaders of The Syndicat used their control over the distribution of food and other provisions to keep the general population in line. Any who resisted The Syndicat had their memories erased and were exiled to other worlds. [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) helped the Phindian population overthrow The Syndicat and install a democratic government, which remained in place until the formation of the Emperor's New Order. Despite a handful of Phindian uprisings (All of which the Imperials easily quelled), the Phindian homeworld remained under Imperial rule until shortly after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). Within a year of their liberation, the Phindian people joined the New Republic and have remained members ever since.
