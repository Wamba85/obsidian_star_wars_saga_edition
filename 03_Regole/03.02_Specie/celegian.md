Celegians are an ancient Species known for their great intellect and wisdom. Evolved from ocean-dwelling invertebrates, the Celegians' ancestors eventually adapted to living on land. The atmosphere of their homeworld is rich in cyanogen gas, which is poisonous to most sentient beings. Conversely, oxygen is lethal to Celegians.

To move their massive jellyfishlike bodies, Celegians evolved a natural form of locomotion similar to a repulsorlift generator. Their soft fleshy bodies, writhing masses of tentacles, and and dependence on life-support chambers result in Celegians looking as if they constantly float in water.
