The Thisspiasians are a warrior culture ruled by both a democratic house and a blood monarch. They have a proud history of military service dating back to the early days of [The Old Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic). During the Clone Wars, Jedi Council member Oppo Rancisis persuades [Thisspias](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thisspias) to side with the Republic, lending their warriors and cunning strategy to the fight against the Confederacy. Their loyalty is rewarded by [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) with orbital bombardments and slavery after the Clone Wars.
