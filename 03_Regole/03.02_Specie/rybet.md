*Rybets Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

A Species of galactic nomads who only interact with others of their kind to mate, Rybets claim to have evolved on [Varl](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Varl), the now ruined homeworld of [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics).  Rybets claim that a war between their Species and the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) nearly destroyed the planet while the Hutts claim they were the sole beings to survive its mysterious devastation before the dawn of recorded history. Hutts may have the better case, but it matters little when such strong hatred exists between Rybets and Hutts.

Rybets are encountered along heavily traveled space lanes in [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim) and [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories). They have shady reputations and shun planet life, preferring to live aboard Starships, orbital facilities, or starports. A few works as transport pilots, Starship mechanics, and spaceport engineers. Many earn a living by operating tramp freighters and hauling small cargoes and contraband.

Fewer than one billion Rybets live in the galaxy, likely due to their solitary natures, a lack of Rybet settlements, and a mutual loathing between the sexes.  Only an overwhelming compulsion to reproduce overcomes this distaste.  Females lay a clutch of between three and eight eggs, and a Rybet couple stays together for a year or two, each taking part in the early rearing of the children until they start to grate on each other's nerves.  If the male doesn't leave of his own accord, he often ends up dead or maimed.  A Rybet mother who slays the father typically sells his ship, giving her young the proceeds with which to start their lives. If not, they must figure out how to make it on their own after their mother tosses them off her ship.

### Rybet Characteristics
**Personality:** Rybets are believed sly, astute, impertinent, and opportunistic. They are well adapted for life in space, prefer a nomadic lifestyle, and would rather live in a Starship's gloomy cargo hold than the most opulent palace on any world. They don't like to stay in one place for long, and their grasp of morals and ethics is questionable at best, though individuals defy some or all of these stereotypes.  Nevertheless, their disdain for the opposite sex of their species is genetically ingrained and seldom overcome.

**Physical Description:** The Rybets are short, squat humanoids with rough-textured green skin and four long fingers and tees that end in vestigial suction cups. Skin colors range from bright green to deep olive, with faint ochre stripes along their cheeks. Their eyes are bulbous and lantern-like, with upper and lower eyelids that close across the center of the eye. Adult males stand between 1.2 and 1.5 meters tall, while females stand between 1.5 and 1.9 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Rybets age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-5 Years | 6-9 Years | 10-40 Years | 41-60 Years | 61-70 Years | 71+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Rybets claim their Species originated on the planet [Varl](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Varl), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). [The Hutt Kajidics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hutt_Kajidics) contest this claim, as do many xenobiologists.

**Languages:** Rybets speak and write their own language (Rybese), which is punctuated with grunts and croaks. Many learn to speak Basic as well.

**Example Names:** Brayg Krenimec, Brilf Greepto, Gribbet, Moruth Doole, Rilba Bronk, Feno Gamoc.

**Adventurers:** Rybet adventurers are typically [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels). Most other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) find the notion of a Rybet [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) laughable, and no Rybet has yet found the life of a [Force Prodigy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigy) alluring.

### Rybet Species Traits
Rybets share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** Male Rybets receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). Female Rybets receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer a -2  penalty to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity). The Rybets' two sexes are more physically dimorphic than the norm among species.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Rybets gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Rybets have a base speed of 4 squares. They also have a swim speed of 4 squares.
- **Breathe Underwater:** As amphibious creatures, Rybets can't drown in water.
- **Mesmerize:** As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a Rybet can make a special attack against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of a single target within 6 squares of the Rybet. The attack modifier is equal to the Rybet's Character Level plus his or her [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier.
    - If the attack is successful, the target loses its [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) for its next turn. If the attack fails, the target is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Rybets can speak, read, and write both Basic and Rybese.
