Gamorreans are green-skinned, porcine creatures native to [Gamorr](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gamorr). Their tendency toward violence makes them valued as criminal enforcers; though viewed as mindless brutes, they don't care so long as they are paid to fight.

Gamorrean civilization revolves around the never-ending wars between their clans. Preferring large melee weapon in combat, many see ranged weapons as cowardly. Males live to fight; females farm, hunt, and manufacture weapons. Inter-clan hatred rarely fades, and anyone hiring Gamorreans should be aware of their clans to avoid infighting.

### Gamorrean Characteristics
**Personality:** Gamorreans are brutish, violent, and proud. They respect physical prowess and have no problem facing death against a foe they feel they are on at least equal footing with.

**Physical Description:** Gamorreans average about 1.8 meters tall, with thick green skin covering powerful muscles. Close-set eyes, a thick snout, tusks, and small horns give them a distinct look.

A Gamorrean is constantly at war; it's only a matter of figuring out who the enemy is. Gamorrean Heroes tend to select the [Soldier](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldier) class.
