Rodians hail from the Tyrius System of [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim), their homeworld humid and choked with heavy rain forests teeming with dangerous life forms. In this hostile environment, the Rodians evolved into brutal hunters and killers to survive. As a result, Rodian culture centers around the concept of "The Hunt." Their art glorifies violence and the art of stalking prey. The more intelligent and dangerous a hunter's prey, the more honorable the hunt. Rodians have numerous annual festivals that exists solely to honor such activities.

Since joining the rest of the galaxy's spacefaring Species, the Rodians have come to view bounty hunting as the most honorable profession in existence, and many have found great success in this field.
