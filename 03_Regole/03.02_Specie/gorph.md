*Gorph Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Gorphs are sentient amphibians native to [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) known for their long and flexible tongues. They live in underground grottos in tribal societies, with a Queen leading her "court" in extravagant ceremonies. The Queen's rule is so monolithic that merely boring her would see one cast into a deep pit for their transgressions. Equal parts cunning, ruthless, and arrogant, Gorphs have no moral qualms with kidnaping and other heinous crimes for their benefit, and [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) still hold the Gorphs in distain for Queen Slugga's attempt to force the planet's princesses into marriage with her son.

### Gorph Characteristics
**Personality:** Gorphs are fundamentally selfish beings, viewing outsiders only by their potential to the Gorph's individual and societal gain. As the most organized populace aside from the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) on the forest moon, Gorphs have also developed a degree of cultural arrogance which has more than once undermined their otherwise clever plots.

**Physical Description:** Sentient frog-like amphibians, Gorphs have green skin, few teeth, and dark green eyes. They stand about 2 meters in height and have long, fleshy pink tongues that can extend a significant distance. Their (somewhat) advanced societies also see Gorphs use simple clothing, a feature they lord over the other residents of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Gorphs age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-27 Years | 28-40 Years | 41-52 Years | 53+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Gorphs are native to [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), living in several underground grottos across its surface.

**Languages:** Gorphese is a chortaling language of croaks and squeals. Most Gorphs also learn Ewokese to better swindle their neighbors.

**Example Names:** Juct, Keizt, Slugga, Teekp, Vork.

**Adventurers:** Gorphs' crafty natural and ambitious attitudes serve them well as [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels). Several also serve as brutish [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) to defend their homes, or as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) to monitor [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) for opportunities for their grottos. 

### Gorph Species Traits

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Gorphs receive a +2 bonus toÂ their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom).

They may also choose to reroll any [Jump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jump) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
