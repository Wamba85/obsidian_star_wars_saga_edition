*Wistie Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

A sentient species native to [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), Wisties are small, winged humanoids with the appearance of a living flame; Endorian mythology claims that Wisties feed off happy emotions and expressions of mirth. However, fire doesn't have anything to do with their luminosity, and they can be safely touched by other creatures most of the time. Although living simple lives, the Wisties still maintain a form of government, with a Queen as Head of State.

Because of their beauty and rarity, Wisties fetched high prices on the illegal market; however, their extreme rarity sees that knowledge of their existence is not widespread in the galactic community. Wisties are fierce defenders of their forests, and close allies with the treebound [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks); when invaded by [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire), the two Species proved crucial in harassing the unprepared Stormtroopers.

### Wistie Characteristics
**Personality:** Wisties are usually peaceful and harmless, although their buzzing and brightly lit night flights often prevents other beings from sleeping, much to the annoyance and discomfort of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes).

**Physical Description:** Wisties are tiny humanoids surrounded by a bright mantle of fluttering flames, varying in color between golden, white, red, or blue. They possess hairlike coronas of light sprouting from the top of their head which appears to "flicker" as a flame would do. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Wisties age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 Years | 3-5 Years | 6-17 Years | 18-23 Years | 24-29 Years | 30+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor); Wisties maintain cordial relations with the tree-dwelling [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks).

**Languages:** Wisties speak their own language, made of squeaking and buzzing noises, which some Ewoks are able to understand with steady patience. Wisties can learn to understand other languages, but lack the ability to speak them.

**Example Names:** Flix, Izrina, Lark, Rilo, Saz, Sypia, Tiz, Zrani.

**Adventurers:** Wisties often work together in aerial swarms alongside their allied [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks). What few choose- or are made to- work independently frequently find roles as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles). Despite their ethereal appearances, Wistie Force-users are nearly nonexistent.
### Wistie Species Traits
Wisties share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Wisties suffer a -4 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), and -2 penalties to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Wisties are flighty and their bodies are particularly delicate.
- **Diminutive Size:** As Diminutive creatures, Wisties gain a +5 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +15 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are one-quarter of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Wisties have a base speed of 2 squares. They additionally possess an inherent Fly speed of 2 squares.
- **Bio-Luminescence:** Wisties glow in the dark, and due to this they never gain [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) or [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment) from darkness. Additionally, Wisties must roll twice when making a [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check, taking the lowest result (see [The Order of Rerolls](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_Rerolls)).
- **Flight:** Wisties are capable of flight, but cannot do so if they are carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Natural Weapons:** A Wistie has Natural Weapons, in the form of their natural flames. When a Wistie makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1 point of [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. A Wistie is always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Primitive:** Wisties do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Wisties can speak Wistiese. They have no written form of their language.
