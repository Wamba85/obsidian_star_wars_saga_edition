Boltrunians are a [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) Species that developed on the Outer Rim world, [Boltrunia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Boltrunia). The planet's [High Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/High_Gravity) forced the Boltrunians to develop massive strength and endurance in order to survive and flourish. As a result, Boltrunian society is a perfect example of survival of the fittest, creating a people who respect pure strength and disdain weakness. Boltrunians have little compassion for those who cannot pull their weight and will often leave weak and infirm to their deaths.

There are two subspecies of Boltrunian- one with green-hued skin and large ears and the other with beige skin and without external ears.
