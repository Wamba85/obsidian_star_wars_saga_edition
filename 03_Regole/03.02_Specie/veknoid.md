An intelligent alien Species from Moonus Mandel characterized by large eyes, floppy ears, and short fur, the Veknoids are sentient lizards with long, spindly limbs and portly midsections. Members of the Veknoids are extremely moralistic and engage frequently in arranged marriages. The aliens are best known as chefs and pilots throughout the galaxy, though they engage in a number of other occupations.

### Veknoid Characteristics
**Personality:** Veknoids are largely traditional in nature, slow to change and isolationist in practice. While not xenophobic like other isolationist [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), Veknoid society has little interest in galactic culture and customs. Veknoids do have a great sense of hospitality, and readily aid any that arrive at their doorsteps. 

**Physical Description:** Veknoids are portly humanoids with brown skin and inset eyes. Their heads spout stubby horns, and they have sharp pointed teeth. Adult Veknoids stand between 1.2 and 1.6 meters tall.  

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Veknoids age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-14 Years | 15-34 Years | 35-44 Years | 45-54 Years | 55+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Moonus Mandell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Moonus_Mandell), a habitable moon orbiting the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/bothan.md|Bothan]] colony world of [Mandell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mandell) in [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim). The world is home to swampy bogs and large, squat forest trees.

**Languages:** Veknoids speak their native tongue of Veknoid, with an intricate written form of hieroglyphics. Basic is taught to young Veknoids to facilitate communications with travelers, and many Veknoids also learn Bothese.

**Example Names:** Moonao Da, Teemto Pagalies, Velkies, Zao.

**Adventurers:** Veknoids don't often leave [Moonus Mandell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Moonus_Mandell), comfortable with their regular lives. Veknoids found offworld are usually exiles finding work as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). Veknoid [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are also common within the Order, with their calm demeanors and patient attitudes.
### Veknoid Species Traits
Veknoids share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Veknoids receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). The lanky Veknoids possess great agility, but little strength.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Veknoids have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Veknoids have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Expert Pilot:** Veknoids are able to react to danger much more quickly than most [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), and may choose to reroll any [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted even if it is worse.
- **Survivalist:** Veknoids are able to make the most of foraged food. On a successful [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) check made for [Basic Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Basic_Survival), a Veknoid can provide food and water for a number of additional beings equal to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Veknoids can speak, read, and write both Basic and Veknoid.
