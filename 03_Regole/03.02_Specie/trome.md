*Trome Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Populated by communities of martial prowess, Tromes are tree-dwelling humanoids with gruff attitudes that use both their strength and clever tricks to scare off potential threats. They have a close sense of comradery, and they can be persuaded to aid their neighbors with reasonable trade. While their contact with [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) is mostly confined to the [Ketes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ketes) aside from the occasional trader, Tromes still prove to be mighty friends and allies to their few neighbors.

### Trome Characteristics
**Personality:** While quick to scare off intruders, members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) can find steadfast allies in the Tromes after pushing past their initial standoff nature. Tromes equally value quick wits and martial strength, helping them thrive on the Forest Moon.

**Physical Description:** Tromes are short humanoids with thick limbs and long beards growing past their knees. Their large noses and expressive eyes help express their sincerity, making their tricks that much more unexpected.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Tromes age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-16 Years | 17-34 Years | 35-49 Years | 50-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Tromes live in tree huts on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), refining sap from their homes for trade with [Strutters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strutters) and [Jindas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jindas).

**Languages:** Tromes speak Tromish, gruff sounds undercuts by their unusually high-pitched voices.

**Example Names:** Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy.

**Adventurers:** Tromes are most at home as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) to best apply their perchance for trickery and raw strength. Other [Heroic Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes) are less common, but clever Tromes can make any role work in their favor.
### Trome Species Traits
Tromes share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Tromes receive a +2 bonus toÂ their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity). Wily and bombastic, Tromes can also come off as a bit clumsy at times.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Tromes gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Tromes have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Trome with [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/combat-trickery.md|Combat Trickery]] as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Primitive:** Tromes do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Strength Surge:** Once per encounter, a Trome can perform one of the following actions:
    - Reroll one [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength)-based [Ability Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_Check) or [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) using a doubled [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier (minimum +1).
    - Add +2 to one damage roll when making a successful melee attack to which a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) bonus is normally added (this benefit does not apply when the [Weapon Finesse](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Finesse) feat is used)
- **Automatic Languages:** All Tromes can speak Tromish. They have no written form of their language.
