*Jenet Species data created by Wikia user Jdborghetti (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Jenets are quarrelsome scavengers who evolved from rodents. Thousands of years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), Jenets eradicated all of their natural predators and quickly overpopulated their homeworld. They used their own [Hyperdrives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrives) to colonize the six other worlds in the Tau Sakar System and have since spread throughout the galaxy, building colonies on far-flung worlds whose isolation coupled with the Species alarming rate of reproduction has created vast, inbred populations. As Jenets prefer to dwell among their own kind, they have never fully integrated into the greater galactic society or sought to join the Republic.

During [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era), the Empire enslaved the Jenet and took advantage of the Species' high reproduction rate, assigning them to dangerous tasks. The Empire went as far as to selectively breed the Jenets in an attempt to make them less intelligent and more compliant and pacifistic. The effects of Imperial experimentation continue to haunt the Jenets for generations afterward.

Jenet society is run like a corporation and has a hopelessly tangled and complex bureaucracy. The Jenets rely on their incredible memories to avoid the common bureaucratic pitfalls. which explains the society's lack of written records. They prefer to live in underground warrens and aren't  fond of tail buildings.

A Jenet's name is more than a simple moniker. The name is an official recounting of everything the Jenet has ever achieved, and two witnesses are required whenever it is used or "Amended."

### Jenet Characteristics
**Personality:** Many [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) find Jenets petulant and insufferable. They are tactless, barely able to contain themselves when faced with ignorance or lies, and obsessed when faced with ignorance or lies, and obsessed with trivial details. Jenets think nothing of berating someone they've never met for a distant acquaintance's transgression.

**Physical Description:** Jenets are 1.5-meter-tall humanoids with pale pink skin, beady red eyes, tufts of white fur, and stiff whiskers.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Jenets age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

**Homeworld:** [Garban](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Garban) is a temperate world in the Outer Rim's Tau Sakar system. The Jenets primarily live in vast subterranean warrens deep below the planet's surface.

**Languages:** Jenets communicate using squeaks, squeals, chatters, and high-pitched barks. They have no written language, instead relying completely on an oral history even for mundane details.

**Example Names:** Channik Who Built a Starfighter and Flew to Ryloth, Lezarn Who Deals in Spice, Rish Who Slew Vahgar the Drunken Houk.
