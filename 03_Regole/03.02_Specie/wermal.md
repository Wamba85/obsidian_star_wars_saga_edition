*Wermal Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Wermals are a bizarre-looking species of long-lived sentients from the galactic North.
### Wermal Characteristics

**Personality:** Wermals are loyal and hardworking to a fault, capable of spending many centuries in the same dead-end job where most other sentients would long ago have quit or died of old age.

**Physical Description:** Wermals are chubby creatures with one large eye, nose-slits, pink skin, and three hearts.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Wermals age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-21 Years | 22-32 Years | 33-350 Years | 351-450 Years | 451-599 Years | 600+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The [Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) world of [Werma Lesser](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Werma_Lesser), also known simply as Werma. The planet is located near the desert planet [Neelgaimon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Neelgaimon) and the border of the Unified [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ruurian.md|Ruurian]] Colonies. Much of the planet's trade is done with [The Corporate Sector](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/CSS_The_Corporate_Sector) via these routes.

**Languages:** Wermals usually speak Basic, though many also pick up Sy Bisti as a trade language.

**Example Names:** Kedpin Shoklop, Monoc Tricor, Pinklod Kepsho, Smee Warsler

**Adventurers:** Wermals often leverage their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) as [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), and [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technician).
### Wermal Species Traits
Wermals share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Wermals receive a +2 bonus to both their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) and [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) and [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity). Wermals are long-lived and sharp-witted, but lacking in awareness and flexibility.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Wermals gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Combat) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Wermals have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Methodical Mind:** Once per encounter, a Wermal can treat one [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) with certain [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) ([Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception), [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information), [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative), [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge), [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics), [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion), [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival), [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury), or [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer)) as though they had [Taken 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Taken_10), even after the roll has been made (but before the result of the check is known).
- **Superior Defenses:** Adapted to a very tough and trying environment, Wermals gain a +1 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to all their [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Wermals can speak, read, and write Basic and Sy Bisti.
