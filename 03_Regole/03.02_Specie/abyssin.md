*Abyssin Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Abyssins are brutish humanoids who thrive on violence. They believe that change is impossible, a belief fostered by their ability to recover quickly from even the most grievous wounds. The Blooding, a ritual combat between two tribes over water rights, is also used to settle impassable disputes between hated enemies. A Blooding is usually a fight to the death between two Abyssins- one champion per tribe- with the winner gaining all of the loser's possessions.

Abyssins are well suited to their natural desert habitat and have a very efficient biology. Often characterized by their single eye, Abyssins don't take kindly to beings who refer to them by derogatory names such as "Monoe," "One-Eye," or "Cyclops."

### Abyssin Characteristics
**Personality:** Abyssins are quick to anger, especially when taunted or otherwise insulted. They hardly ever need to show restraint and are well known for their quarrelsome nature. Abyssin society is primitive, and individuals show little interest in anything other than basic comforts. All Abyssins dislike space battles and blaster fire.

**Physical Description:** Abyssins are slightly hunched, hulking humanoids with long limbs, lank but muscular bodies, weathered skin, and a single slit-pupiled eye. The average Abyssin Adult stands about 2 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):**Â Abyssins age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-30 Years | 31-65 Years | 66-150 Years | 151-220 Years | 221-300 Years | 301+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The planet [Byss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Byss), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim), is a mostly arid sphere that orbits twin suns in a figure-eight pattern. The Burning- the leg of Byss's orbit that carries it between the twin suns- is a grueling time when temperatures rise, weather is unpredictable, and sunlight scorches the entire planet.

**Languages:** Abyssins have their own spoken language (Abyssin). The spoken language consists of primitive-sounding grunts and growls, and the written language is based on a simple set of hieroglyphs.

**Example Names:** Anami, Easym, Mador, Myo, Polcyc, Vomak.

**Adventurers:** Abyssins rarely leave [Byss](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Byss), as they are quite satisfied with their lot in life. Those who do are usually taken as slaves by representatives of more technologically advanced cultures. A few Abyssins who venture offworld end up as laborers, thugs, or prize brawlers. Particularly resourceful Abyssins find work as bodyguards or with organized crime syndicates.
