Yarkora are among the most mysterious Species in the galaxy. Though individual Yarkora made their way into the vast, galactic underworld for many decades, the Species as a whole managed to escape formal notice until after the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin). During [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times), the Yarkora perform the activities they are known for: information brokering, petty theft, and the occasional con job.

Yarkora are adept at gathering information, aided by their acute senses of sight and hearing. Most Yarkora try to keep a low profile by acting alone. However, those who find a ship or gang useful have no trouble gathering the needed henchmen, thanks to their natural charisma.

They often promote a distinguished appearance, even when dressed in the lowliest garb.

**Adventurers:** Yarkora adventurers are usually [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels).
