Ssori are small, yellow-skinned reptilians with large protrusions on either side of their head. The Ssori admire innovation and technology as a means to put them on equal footing with other, larger [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) in the galaxy. They have a proud tradition of gifted engineers and scientists, and many corporations recruit directly from their best schools.
### Ssori Characteristics
**Personality:** Ssori have an admiration for technological progress, viewing innovation as the advancement of the galaxy at large. To that end, most Ssori are intellectuals and constantly seek to expand their knowledge.

**Physical Description:** While it is typical for many Ssori to be seen wearing mechanical suits to compensate for their diminutive size (such as a [Prototype War Walker](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prototype_War_Walker)), underneath they have bulbous heads and large eyes on a small reptilian body.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ssori age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

**Languages:** Ssori is a complex language, with multiple different words to describe intricate mechanical nuance in a single phrase.

**Example Names:** Carklin Ryoon, Seripas.

**Adventurers:** Due to their diminutive size, Ssori typically travel in mechanical suits, such as [Prototype War Walkers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prototype_War_Walkers). Their technical expertise makes Ssori capable [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels), though many are equally capable of adapting to other [Heroic Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes).
