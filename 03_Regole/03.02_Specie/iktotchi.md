Hailing from [The Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region) world of [Iktotchon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iktotchon) and its moon, [Iktotch](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iktotch), the Iktotchi are a race of precognitive humanoids. All Iktotchi possess this precognitive ability, which manifests as vivid dreams, visions, or waking dreams. Few Iktotchi have control of how or when their precognition manifests or of what it reveals to them. As a Species, they know of the Republic's coming long before their world is visited, and they are prepared to welcome the guests that would usher them into a vast galactic society. Iktotchi are famed for their prowess as pilots, and attribute their success at the helm to nearly imperceptible precognitive inclinations.

Because of their visions, Iktotchi are aware of the bloodshed that heralds the coming of the Clone Wars. Many of the era's prominent diplomats are Iktotchi who seek to avert the impending violence.
