Sakiyans rarely venture far from their home system, showing little interest in traveling or trading with the galaxy at large.

During the days of the Old Republic, there was some dispute among xenobiologists as to whether the Sakiyans should be classified as a [Near-Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Human) Species. The unusual structure of their brain led Imperial xenobiologists to conclude that they were a distinctly alien Species.

The highly evolved Sakiyan brain is nearly twice the size of the average [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] brain. While the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/bith.md|Bith]] brain remains one of the most advanced among common alien [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), the parts of the Sakiyan brain that process sensory input are superior even to the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/bith.md|Bith]]. These keen senses helped primitive Sakiyans survive against the fierce predators of their homeworld, but even as the Species developed the intellect to use tools and construct weapons and shelters, they retained their sharp senses. In fact, Sakiyans possess what other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) consider nigh-supernatural perception.

A series of offworld invasions punctuate Sakiyan history, during which the culture survived by maintaining a constant state of vigilance. Evacuation plans are meticulously prepared and constantly revised. Most Sakiyan communities have multiple plans for evacuation in case of invasion and war. Further, every household and government agency relies on lightweight repulsorlift platforms to quickly transport people, resources, and supplies to safe havens.

Once mobile, Sakiyan troops then conduct a constant series of hit-and-run attacks against enemies until their invaders withdraw from the conquered lands. Sakiyan colonies carry with them the tradition of defense and mobility, resisting domination by [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith), the forces of the Tion Hegemony, and other oppressors. In recent centuries, they have fallen under the economic control of the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts), but have averted outright enslavement by keeping the "Slugs" at arm's length in every place except Saki's major trade centers.

The ties between the Sakiyans and the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) are primarily forged around repulsorlift technology. Sakiyans quickly adopted and improved repulsorlift technology introduced to them by Old Republic scouts. Over the centuries, they have adapted the technology to their needs, focusing primarily on making the motivators smaller and more efficient. The [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts) are particularly fond of Sakiyan repulsorlift technology, as it allows them to construct smaller and more elegant repulsor sleds.

Thanks to its location near the heart of Hutt Space, the Sakiyan homeworld escaped the tyranny of the Empire, although many Sakiyan technicians were forced to relocate to Imperial research installations, where they contributed to the development of a new generation of Imperial repulsortanks. The Saki System also escaped the notice of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] as they pressed into Hutt Space- at least during the first advance. The Sakiyan leadership remains concerned that their traditional method of dealing with alien invasions may not work if the war fleets of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] strike against their home. While they generally ignored Hapans and New Republic political overtures before the appearance of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] (directing them instead to the [Hutts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hutts)), the Sakiyans have shown an interest in helping [The Hapes Consortium](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hapes_Consortium) and [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic) mount a counter-offensive.

Some Sakiyans become bounty hunters and assassins, using their keen senses to track down their prey. Sakiyan Force-users are rare.
