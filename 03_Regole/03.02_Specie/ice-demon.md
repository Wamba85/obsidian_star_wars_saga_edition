*Ice Demon Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Sentient crystalline creatures with the appearance of living frost, Ice Demons are gruff tribes of hunters and shamans that live in the frigid mountains of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). Guided by elders' insights of [Totem Magic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Totem_Magic), Ice Demons have sequestered themselves far from [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), to the point even [Frostsprites](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Frostsprites) and [Iceheads](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iceheads) think them little more than myth. But while passively isolationist as a whole, individual Ice Demons are known to menace their neighbors with an arrogant certainty of their supremacy.
### Ice Demon Characteristics
**Personality:** Ice Demons are gruff and dismissive in their interactions with outsiders, with only the most crafty of Frostsprite traders able to worm their way into their villages. Despite this, they don't destain [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), merely viewing them as irrelevant to their lives.

**Physical Description:** placeholder

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ice Demons age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-14 Years | 15-22 Years | 23-79 Years | 80-99 Years | 100-119 Years | 120+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Communities of Ice Demons live in only the harshest and most destitute of the snowy mountains of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor).

**Languages:** Rimese is a shared language amongst [Frostsprites](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Frostsprites), [Iceheads](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Iceheads), and Ice Demons. It carries sharp tones that cut through the high winds of their homes.

**Example Names:** Bliddz, Charrg, Stagorr, Thinkorr.

**Adventurers:** Ice Demon [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) are the most respected shamans of their communities, served by the [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) of their fellows. Very few are Nobles or Scoundrels, believing such roles to be wasteful and unnecessary.
### Ice Demon Species Traits
Ice Demons share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Ice Demons receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Ice Demons are carefully meticulous in their work, but are largely dismissive of outsiders.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Ice Demons have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Ice Demons have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Cold Resistance:** Ice Demons gain a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) to resist [Extreme Cold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Cold).
- **Impede Area:** Ice Demons are capable of quickly freezing over their surroundings on a whim. As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), an Ice Demon can make an adjacent square into [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) until the end of the encounter.
- **Primitive:** Ice Demons do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Ice Demons can speak Rimese. They have no written form of their language.
