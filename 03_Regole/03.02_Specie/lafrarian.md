*Homebrew Reference Book: [Corporate Sector Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Sector_Sourcebook)*

Lafrarians are a humanoid Species descended from avians. While their appearance appears quite similar to [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), their biology is quite distinct. Lafrarians are fond of elaborate adornments, including a variety of rings and pierced jewelry on their ears, noses, mouths, cheeks, fingers, and other areas of thick cartilage. Lafrarians normally have small growths of feathers on the head; in recent years, many Lafrarians have taken to using "thickening agents" to make their feathers appear similar to hair. 

Long ago, Lafrarians lost the ability for flight, but once they developed the technology for motorized flight, they found they have an amazing aptitude for it. Most beings on [Lafra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lafra) own personal flying speeders or more primitive craft; land or water transport is very rarely used. Lafrarians build their settlements in the tops of trees, high on mountainsides, and in other areas that are nearly inaccessible for non-flying creatures.

### Lafrarian Characteristics
**Personality:** Lafrarians' enjoyment of flight can be found in every pilot on [Lafra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lafra), and a Lafrarian's mood can jokingly be measured in the time since they last flew.

**Physical Description:** Lafrarians are characterized by thin builds, vestigial soaring membranes, and sharp features; their entire nose, mouth, and cheek area is made of thick cartilage. They have slightly elongated skulls with pointed ears and their bodies are covered with smooth skin. Lafrarian skin tends to be gray, although some have very dark or light skin.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Lafrarians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-14 Years | 15-49 Years | 50-69 Years | 70-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Lafra](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lafra), in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim), is a world with a variety of terrain.

**Languages:** Lafrarian can travel far when spoken, and is comparable to a flute in its pitches.

**Example Names:** Maur Howins, Nuyu.

**Adventurers:** Lafrarians are expert pilots, usually as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). Other [Heroic Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Classes) are perfectly viable as well, though not quite to the same degree of proficiency.
### Lafrarian Species Traits
Lafrarians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Lafrarians receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). Lafrarians' avian ancestor has given them excellent agility, but they are physically weaker than most.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Lafrarians have no special bonuses or penalties due  to their size.
- **Speed:** Lafrarians have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Lafrarian with [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Pilot)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Pilot)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Expert Climber:** Lafrarians may choose to [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on [Climb](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Climb) checks, even when distracted or threatened.
- **Heightened Awareness:** Lafrarians may choose to reroll any [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Lafrarians can speak, read, and write both Basic and Lafrarian.
