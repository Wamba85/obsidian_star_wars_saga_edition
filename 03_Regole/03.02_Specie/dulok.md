*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Species Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Species_Sourcebook)*

The meddlesome Duloks have become an inescapable headache for [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). Closely related to the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), the Duloks are bad-tempered swamp-dwellers who can be useful as trade partners but are more commonly feared as harmful raiders.

Unapologetic barbarians, Duloks live in isolated tribes in the swamplands of the Forest Moon. They use simple wood-and-stone weapons to hunt, and dwell in mud huts or caves. They have great disdain for the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), believing that the forest spirits abandoned them when they gave the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) the run of the forests and left the Duloks the swamps. This hatred has turned to war- not only between the Duloks and the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), but between Dulok tribes who compete for the swamp's scarce resources. The [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) know better than to underestimate their cousins, for many tribes have fallen to Dulok armies.

Dulok tribes are headed by a chief, with a revered shaman or medicine man offering advice. The shaman is often strong with [The Living Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Living_Force) and capable of great "magic." Many shamans dabble in dark energies, although a few use their abilities for the betterment of the tribe. These peaceful shamans are seen as eccentric oddities and often baffle their tribemates. Females are considered little more than pup-sitters and breeders; despite the fact that females are usually smarter than males and make excellent scouts, it is extremely rare to see a female shaman or warrior. Slavery is the primary form of barter between Dulok tribes, and they enjoy limited trade between the [Jindas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jindas) and the [Gupins](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gupins).

### Dulok Characteristics
**Personality:** In contrast to [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), Duloks have little respect for nature and are known to be greedy and foul-tempered. They are aggressive and warlike, and frequently raid nearby settlements, particularly [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ewok.md|Ewok]] villages. Females Duloks are generally more clever and observant than their male counterparts.

**Physical Description:** Duloks are taller than [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), with body fur ranging in color from moss green to murky brown. Each has a long, stiff tail that ends in a bushy tuft, and their jaws jut out in a pronounced underbite. Duloks frequently shave, brand, and paint tribal marks into their fur, and wear feather and bone accessories to further declare their status within the tribe.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Duloks age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-15 Years | 16-49 Years | 50-74 Years | 75-129 Years | 130+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), mostly residing around the swampy regions of the planet.

**Languages:** Many Duloks speak a language intelligible to outsiders, and some are proficiency in Ewokese.

**Example Names:** Boogutt, Gorneesh, Murgoob, Ulgo, Umwak, Urgah, Vulgarr.

**Adventurers:** Rarely do Duloks find their way offworld, usually as unwitting stowaways on ships that crashed and were then repaired. Those that leave the Sanctuary Moon are often [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) or [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). The Duloks are said to worship some sort of malevolent Night Spirit, which may possibly a [Dark Side Spirit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Spirit) or perhaps a Force-witch. While each tribe has one or more shamans, their degree of Force sensitivity is unclear.

- **Scent:** At close range (within 10 squares), Duloks ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) and [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) for purposes of [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks, and take no penalty from poor visibility while [Tracking](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tracking).
- **Survivalist:** On a successful [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) check made for [Basic Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Basic_Survival), a Dulok can provide food and water for a number of additional beings equal to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier.
