*Filvian Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Aliens Stats counterpart).*

Filvians are intelligent quadrupeds that evolved in the stark deserts of [Filve](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Filve). While they can survive in the harsh conditions of the desert, they prefer the cooler temperatures found in the extreme regions of their world and on other planets. Their front two legs have dexterous three-toed feet, which they also use for tool manipulation (A Filvian can walk on two legs, but they are much slower when forced to move in this manner).

Filvians are efficient survivors, capable of going as long as 30 standard days without food or water. They enjoy contact with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) and it is this desire to mingle with others that inspired the Filvians to construct an Imperial starport on their planet.

Once a primitive people, the Filvians have learned- and in some cases mastered- modern technology; computers in particular. Filvian computer operators and repair techs are highly respected in their field, and many of the galaxy's most popular computer systems had Filvian programmers.
### Filvian Characteristics

**Personality:** Filvians are good-natured, with a fondness for communication. They are eager to learn about others and make every effort to understand the perspectives of others. The Filvian government has made valiant efforts to placate the Empire, but its representatives would prefer to see the Republic return to power. 

**Physical Description:** Filvians have large water- and fat- storage hump along their backs, as well as several smaller body glands that serve the same function and give their bodies a distinctive "Bumpy" appearance. They have a covering of short, fine hair, which ranges from light brown to yellow or white in color.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Filvians age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-19 Years | 20-50 Years | 51-70 Years | 71-89 Years | 90+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Filve](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Filve) is a hot, dry world in [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim). As the planet boarders a number of the galaxy's wealthiest corporations, such as Sienar and BlasTech Industries, it receives much unwanted attention from Imperial forces, both in the form of actual attacks on the planet and damage from battles occurring above it. 

**Languages:** Filvians have adopted the Basic from so long that it has become their native language.

**Example Names:** H'nib Statermast, H'cohn Filermist, H'tas Hogelhoft.

**Adventurers:** Filvians are fascinated by new devices and unfamiliar machinery, and easily pick up new technical skills. Filvian are fond of expanding their scientific and technical knowledge, and eventually venture to the space with a deep envy for technological discoveries. They are thus often [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and become often among the galaxy's foremost computer programmers, slicers, and mechanics.
