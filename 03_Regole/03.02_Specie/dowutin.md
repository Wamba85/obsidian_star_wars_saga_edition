*Dowutin Species data created by Wikia user Darthauthor.*

The Dowutins are a long-lived Species of muscle-bound humanoids. So extensive are their lifespans. in fact. it is said that no Dowutin has ever died of old age, instead failing in battle or succumbing to the many perils of [Dowut](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dowut). Whether this is true or a myth perpetuated by Dowutin boasting is difficult to say. It is certain, however, that Dowutins are among the strongest and toughest sentients in the galaxy. For these reasons, they are highly sought as soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards. However, Dowutin arrogance is often just as immense, and few condescend to serve what they perceive as weaker beings.

Dowutins prize physical strength and vigor, but in a very different way than most sentient species. For a Dowutin. strength and even combat training are not matters of pride, but matters of pragmatism; on [Dowut](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dowut), those with strength and skill get the resources and respect they are due. Many Dowutins who leave their homeworld are surprised and confused by the criteria the rest of the galaxy uses to assign authority, political power, and leadership positions. More than one Dovvutin has had difficulty adapting and found themselves in deep trouble for it.

Most Dowutins are solitary by choice, although this does not stop a Dowutin from joining forces with others when expedient. Rare, however, are Dowutins who stoop to taking orders from beings smaller or weaker than themselves. Many sentients who find themselves working with Dowutins learn to frame directives as suggestions or even questions, even when they are technically or practically in a position to issue orders or guidance. In some cases, others find it necessary to leave Dowutins under the impression they are in charge, if for no other reason than to keep operations running smoothly.

### Dowutin Characteristics
**Personality:** Dowutins have a reputation for being unfriendly, even irritable. Although deserved, this too stems from the Species' unusual perspective. Dowutins are as direct in their speech as in any other undertaking, and most have no qualms against speaking the truth as they see it, no matter how harsh it might be. A typical Dowutin simply does not see the point in mincing words. Obfuscation and deception, even to avoid giving offense, complicate matters and cause problems. Many who interact with Dowutins also assume the Species incapable of humor. Although this is not strictly true. Dowutins rarely suffer fools. The sorts of misunderstandings, mishaps, ironies, and even quips that others might find amusing, a typical Dowutin sees only as annoying.
