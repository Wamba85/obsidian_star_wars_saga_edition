*Gupin Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Gupins are even shorter than [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), but only when they want to be. These elfin shapeshifters have used their biological gifts to survive against much larger predators, who would otherwise have exterminated them long ago.  On the Forest Moon, the rapacious [Grass Trekkers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Trekkers) have pushed the Gupin population to its survival limits. 

Modern Gupins don't remember how their Species first came to [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), but have lived on their new home so long they refer to the [Grass Trekkers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Trekkers) as the "old enemy." For centuries they have inhabited a dormant, volcanic crater at the edge of the Desert of Salma, near the grass plains east of the Great Forest. Wells irrigate the crater's inner bowl, and the Gupins subsist on carefully-cultivated gardens and orchards. Most [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks) have never seen a Gupin, owing to the territorial grasslands of the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/fftssfft.md|Fftssfft]] separating the two. 

As a Species, Gupins are highly sensitive to [The Living Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Living_Force), a trait which appears to be linked to their shapeshifting. A Gupin may ask others to "draw out the energy in your minds and hold it firm" before they cast a shape, and this attention from other living beings seems to ease the transformation. In addition, a relic of [Totem Magic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Totem_Magic) resting in a vessel called the Juniper Chest has become the centerpiece of Gupin life; the relic apparently amplifies the Gupins' natural morphic abilities. The Gupins have developed a host of unnecessary rituals surrounding the Juniper Chest, including a ceremony known as the Time of Renewal and a supposed "magical" key that opens the chest. 

### Gupin Characteristics
**Personality:** The Gupins are barricaded against intrusion, for the [Grass Trekkers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Trekkers) (whose lair is only a short distance away) assault their home at least once per month. Gupins venture into the grasslands to trade with other members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes), typically [Jindas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jindas) and [Duloks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Duloks), but do not stray far from their home. 

**Physical Description:** Gupins look vaguely humanoid, but with bushy eyebrows, oversized front teeth, and antennae in place of ears. All Gupins have tails, and in late adolescence they grow short membranous wings. Their shapeshifting abilities are not restricted by their musculature or skeletal structure, and Gupins have been known to squash themselves as flat as blankets or morph into four-legged beasts. To the fascination of xenobiologists, they can assume forms that are larger and heavier than their natural forms. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Gupins age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-16 Years | 17-29 Years | 30-44 Years | 45-59 Years | 60+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Planetary anthropologists believe the Gupins came to [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) aboard the *Starhunter Dhelba* menagerie ark, and so far no one has determined the Species' planet of origin. Given their small size and genial temperaments, it seems likely that their shapeshifting abilities evolved as an adaptation against extreme environmental stress.

**Languages:** Gupin is a simple language that can be spoken even shapeshifted into a more beasial creature.

**Example Names:** Mef, Mring-Mring, Oobel, Punt.

**Adventurers:** A Gupin's natural shapeshifting makes them excellent [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), the former in social environments and the latter in the wilds. [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) are slightly less common, but Gupin [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) and vanishingly rare.
### Gupin Species Traits
Gupins share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Gupins suffer -2 penalties to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Gupins are noticeably frail, both for the hollow bones needed for flight and their malleable nature.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Gupins gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Gupins have a base speed of 4 squares. They also have a fly speed of 2 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Gupin gains [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/metamorph.md|Metamorph]] as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) at 1st level, provided he or she meets the prerequisites of the Feat (minimum [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) of 13 and [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception)).
- **Flight:** Gupins are capable of flight, but cannot do so if they are carrying a [Heavy Load](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Load).
- **Heat Resistance:** Gupins have adapted to the dangerous caverns of volcanoes and receive a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) against [Extreme Heat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Heat).
- **Primitive:** Gupins do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Shapeshift:** Gupins are shapechangers and can alter their appearance at will (see the [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) skill). While Shapeshifted, a Gupin gains a +10 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus on [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) checks made to disguise appearance. Additionally, a Gupin can disguise its appearance as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) at no penalty.
    - Gupins cannot alter their size without the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/metamorph.md|Metamorph]] feat.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Gupins can speak, read, and write Gupin. They can also speak Ewokese.
