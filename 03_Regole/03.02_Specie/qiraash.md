*Qiraash Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

The Qiraash are a Species of [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) notable for their tall craniums and hairless bodies. As with many other non-[Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans), Qiraash are largely relegated to second-class citizens during the reign of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire). Those few that left [Qiraash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Qiraash_(Planet)) did so unwillingly, and almost always as slaves.

Often prized for their intense memory retention, an elder Qiraash is practically a living database, and such an ability allows Qiraash to excel in business and management. A far less well-known ability of the Qiraash, however, is their seemingly precognitive instincts, allowing them to foresee incoming danger. While this seems to suggest that all Qiraash have a degree of Force-sensitivity, very few Qiraash have actively wielded [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) in known history.

### Qiraash Characteristics
**Personality:** Qiraash are often fairly standoffish, and uncomfortable outside of their element. Most pursue careers in business and management, making use of their heightened memory and intellect.  

**Physical Description:** Qiraash are pale, largely bald Near-Humans most distinctive for their elongated cranium. With the exception of their napes and eyes, Qiraash are entirely hairless. What little hair they do possess is often plaited into complex braids and coiffures.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Qiraash age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-9 Years | 10-17 Years | 18-79 Years | 80-94 Years | 95-104 Years | 105+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Qiraash hail from [Qiraash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Qiraash_(Planet)), a minor industrial world with largely commercial production. 

**Languages:** Qiraash society has completely integrated into the greater galaxy, and Basic is the primary language. The language Qiraash is typically spoken only by academics.  

**Example Names:** Doffen Gaitag, Qimberly Gaitag-Delio, Leesub Sirln.

**Adventurers:** Qiraash are often [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) of their corporations, with some [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) handling the more unsavory aspects of business. Those more daring (and reckless) might serve as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), and those with greater precognition than their peers might become [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi). Qiraash society views [Corporate Agents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Agents) in an over-romanticized view.
