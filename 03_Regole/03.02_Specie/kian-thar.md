*Kian'thar Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Kian'thar are reptilian humanoids who evolved in the dark swamps of [Shaum Hii](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shaum_Hii). At some point in their evolution, they moved out of the swamps and onto the shores. Kian'thar use beasts for transportation and labor, commonly riding large flying creatures known as [Bentails](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bentails). Most make their living breeding large aquatic herd animals called [Derlac](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Derlac).

Kian'thar congregate in small villages built over shallow water. [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/shistavanen.md|Shistavanen]] explorers made first contact with the Species three centuries before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin). This encounter with offworlders split the Kian'thar into two factions: the Iith'lon (Or Preservers) and the Lllun (The Progressives). The Iith'lon prefer not to deal with offworlders, while the Lllun seek to join the greater galactic community. Although they have different opinions concerning the future of the Kian'thar Species, the two factions do not feud.

More than two million Kian'thar have left their homeworld since the Species' first contact with the [Shistavanens](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shistavanens), seeking fortune among the stars.

### Kian'thar Characteristics
**Personality:** Kian'thar are natural empaths who are prone to wanderlust and flights of fancy- the same qualities that spurred their ancestors to leave the marshes and assume a more nomadic lifestyle. Kian'thar are also hard workers, accustomed to few technological advances. Although they have mood swings, most Kian'thar prefer to resolve disputes peacefully rather than settle them through violence. 

**Physical Description:** Kian'thar have large heads, deep-set glassy eyes, olfactory organs consisting of two dangling tendrils, and shifting keratin plates protecting their necks. Their bodies are covered with fine scales. The average Kian'thar adult stands 1.9 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Kian'thar age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-16 Years | 17-49 Years | 50-69 Years | 70-84 Years | 85+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Shaum Hii](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shaum_Hii), located in The Outer Rim's Tragan Cluster, has vast bodies of water dotted with marshy swamplands. The Kian'thar live in small villages of modest buildings lashed together and suspended over the marshy shores.

**Languages:** Kian'thar is a language of croaks, honks, and water bubbling sounds. Written Kian'thar uses a simple alphabet and short phrases.

**Example Names:** Khral'Nas, Kreet'ah, Llleag'Mak, Lliegis'Nevz, Ttul'Thar.

**Adventurers:** Kian'thar interested in becoming part of the galactic society enjoy the challenges that come with being away from [Shaum Hii](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shaum_Hii). Scrupulous Kian'thar put their empathic talent to work as mediators and counselors, while more dubious representatives of the Species make their way as con artists and criminals; most often becoming [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel).
