*Grass Trekker Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Brutish beasts populating the eastern edge of the Desert of Salma, Grass Trekkers are [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor)-born predators who have long hated the [Gupins](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gupins) for encroaching on their hunting territories. Though not fully sentient, Grass Trekkers can wield simple bludgeoning tools such as clubs and battering rams. 

When hunting food, Grass Trekkers venture into the grasslands east of the Great Forest to prey on [Makants](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Makants), [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/fftssfft.md|Fftssfft]], and the occasional [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gupin.md|Gupin]], but despite their name they prefer to live in the dead, dusty wastelands at Salma's fringe. There, not far from the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/gupin.md|Gupin]] fortress, the Grass Trekkers nest in an anthill-like structure known as the Shrine. The Grass Trekkers regularly band together and attempt to overrun the stronghold of their enemies, but the shape-changing [Gupins](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gupins) usually send them running. The only creatures fierce enough to prey on Grass Trekkers are giant [Goraxes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Goraxes), who sometimes pass through the area on their way to menace [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ewok.md|Ewok]] tree villages. 

### Grass Trekker Characteristics
**Personality:** Extremely hostile to outsiders, clans of Grass Trekkers maintain a hierarchy of aggression, with the strongest and most ambitious rising to positions of leadership in their communities.

**Physical Description:** Grass Trekkers are gangly, bipedal mammals standing between 3 and 3.5 meters tall, with black, greasy fur shot through with white streaks growing thickly over on their heads and backs. Their long snouts and yellow, pupil-less eyes make them look almost demonic.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Grass Trekkers age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-4 Years | 5-11 Years | 12-24 Years | 25-30 Years | 31-35 Years | 36+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Grass Trekkers live in the most inhospitably arid regions of [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), directly bordering the grasslands of [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/fftssfft.md|Fftssfft]] which their constant skirmishes have made even more dangerous for [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes).

**Languages:** Trekk is a simple language that expresses basic ideas in few syllables, but is difficult to provide descriptions for.

**Example Names:** Bash, Crunch, Pound, Swat, Thud.

**Adventurers:** Grass Trekkers are mostly [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), leveraging their large sizes for greater brute force. Some instead might act as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), using their keen senses to hunt in their desolate territories. Grass Trekker [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) are rare, but a handful in each tribe help to lead raids on their neighbors. Force-using Grass Trekkers are almost nonexistent, and fall to [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) in short order.
### Grass Trekker Species Traits
Grass Trekkers share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Grass Trekkers receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). A Grass Trekker's aggressive nature pits them against most outsiders, though they do possess a careful sense of precision.
- **Large Size:** As Large creatures, Grass Trekkers take a -1 size penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a -5 size penalty on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks, and they gain a +5 size bonus to their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). Their lifting and carrying limits are double those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Grass Trekkers have a base speed of 8 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** A Grass Trekker with [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Perception)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Perception)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Primitive:** Grass Trekkers do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Strength Surge:** Once per encounter, a Grass Trekker can perform one of the following actions:
    - Reroll one [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength)-based [Ability Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_Check) or [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) using a doubled [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier (minimum +1).
    - Add +2 to one damage roll when making a successful melee attack to which a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) bonus is normally added (this benefit does not apply when the [Weapon Finesse](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Finesse) feat is used)
- **Automatic Languages:** All Grass Trekkers can speak Trekk. They have no written form of their language.
