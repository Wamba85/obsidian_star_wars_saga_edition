*Sarkan Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*
Sarkans do not typically leave their homeworld. When they must travel the galaxy, they usually do so in groups of at least three, a holdover from a time when their society was heavily dominated by a caste structure. Solitary Sarkans are usually outcasts who have committed a grave offense on their homeworld.

Sarkan technology is equal to the galactic norm, but the Species never developed its own space travel. Outsiders found Sarkans difficult to interact with on a business or diplomatic level, as their intricate culture focuses on rigid, arcane codes of conduct that visiting aliens are expected to know. Those who violate Sarkan codes of conduct are dismissed as barbarians and removed from the presence of high-ranking Sarkans by efficient bodyguards. ln addition to using their thick tails for added balance and stability, Sarkans trained in native martial arts traditions learn to use them as weapons.

During the reign of the Empire, the Sarkans begrudgingly allowed [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) and representatives from companies that were known to have the Emperor's favor to insult them by not adhering to the proper rituals. However, as soon as word of the Emperor's death reached their ears, they returned to their traditional ways- as one startled SoroSuub broker discovered when the Sarkans suddenly demanded a formal greeting in their native tongue. SoroSuub has been trying to reestablish trade relations with [Sarka](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sarka) ever since.

Nova rubies are among the most common gemstones on [Sarka](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sarka), but they appear on no other world and remain a valuable commodity in most of the settled galaxy. Sarkans have used the nova rubies to become fabulously wealthy, and while some of the galaxy's most luxurious resorts and spaceports lie on [Sarka](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sarka), the natives find the "Foolish Aliens" who covet the useless glowing stones amusing.

### Sarkan Characteristics
**Personality:** Proud and aloof, Sarkans value ritual and protocol and have little patience for those who demonstrate an ignorance of Sarkan customs and culture. They consider even innocent comparisons to other cultures an insult. Most Sarkans are condescending, uptight, and difficult to please, but they can also be gracious and helpful to individuals who earn their respect or friendship.

**Physical Description:** Sarkans are tall reptiles with green scaly hides, yellow eyes with slit pupils, and thick tails. They have tapered snouts, and their mouths are filled with razor-sharp fangs. They often decorate their claws with multicolored varnish and clan symbols. They favor brightly colored, baggy clothing frequently decorated with gemstones. Males and females both stand between 1.9 and 2.2 meters tall as adults.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Sarkans age at the following stages:

| **CHILD** | **YOUNG ADULT** | **ADULT** | **MIDDLE AGE** | **OLD** | **VENERABLE** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 Years | 13-18 Years | 19-50 Years | 51-79 Years | 80-95 Years | 96+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The gem-rich planet of [Sarka](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sarka), located in [The Mid Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mid_Rim).

**Languages:** Sarkans speak Sarkese, a complex language that uses both words and subtle body gestures. Sarkan diplomats and explorers usually learn to speak Basic as well.

### Sarkan Species Traits
Sarkans share the following Species Traits.
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Sarkans receive a +2 bonus to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). The Sarkans' extensive use of traditional protocol makes outsiders almost impossible to relate with.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Sarkans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Sarkans have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** With their extensive knowledge of customs and protocol, a Sarkan with [Knowledge (Bureaucracy)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Bureaucracy)) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Knowledge (Bureaucracy))](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Knowledge_(Bureaucracy))) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Natural Weapons:** A Sarkan has Natural Weapons, in the form of its sharp claws. When a Sarkan makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Sarkans are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Xenophobia:** Sarkans have impossible standards of protocol that they hold outsiders to memorize. Sarkans gain a +2 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to improve their [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) by any creature of a different [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
- **Automatic Languages:** All Sarkans can speak, read, and write both Basic and Sarkese.
