*Cosian Species data created by TheSagaContinues user Serfious.*

The reptilian Cosians have a hunched posture and gentle demeanor that leaves an impression of harmlessness, helplessness, or even senility- but that could not be further from the truth. The sharp minds and keen senses of the Cosian are valued among adventurers, constantly observing and eager to learn more about the larger galaxy. The combination of an aged sense of wisdom and a genuine childlike excitement at the discovery of new places and beings casts the Cosian as a bit of a paradox. Any Cosian will tell you that they are simply taking each day as it arrives, and that anyone who believes they have learned all there is to learn is doing themselves a great disservice.
