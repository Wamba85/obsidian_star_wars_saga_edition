*Colicoid Species data created by unknown Wikia user (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Colicoids are an insectoid species native to [Coila IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coila_IV). In Battle, Colicoids curl up into a protective ball, then unfurl suddenly, catching their prey off guard. Their alien, insectoid minds give them a natural defense against Jedi *[Mind Tricks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Tricks)*.

Colicoids are highly intelligent, emotionless, and cannibalistic (particularly when food is scarce). Long ago, they transferred their ruthlessness to commerce, making them brutally efficient at business. Despite the Colicoids' successful commercial ventures and their strict business protocols, enough visitors to the Colla System have been murdered and consumed by the Colicoids that [Colla IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Colla_IV) has spent years in diplomatic disputes. Many diplomats consider an assignment to [Colla IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Colla_IV) a death sentence.

Colicoids are responsible for designing the Trade Federation's murderous [Droideka-Series Destroyer Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droideka-Series_Destroyer_Droids), which were fashioned to resemble their creators.

### Colicoid Characteristics
**Personality:** Colicoids posses a ruthless cunning that serves them well on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. They are vicious, calculating creatures driven by greed, and they show little regard for others.

**Physical Description:** Colicoids are tall, insectoid beings with multiple appendages, chitinous bodies, and powerful stinging tails. Their flat heads have multi-faceted eyes that give them superior vision, and their long antennae provide an acute sense of smell. Adult Colicoids average 1.8 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Colicoids age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-4 Years | 5-7 Years | 8-33 Years | 34-49 Years | 50-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Colla IV](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Colla_IV), located on the border of [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim) and [The Expansion Region](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Expansion_Region).

**Languages:** The Colicoid language involves clicks and humming noises from their antennae and jointed legs, which is difficult to interpret and impossible for other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to reproduce. They speak basic with a noticeable buzz. Colicoids often converse in their own language while in the presence of other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) - few would be pleased to hear what schemes and plots the Colicoids discuss right in front of them. Colicoids do not have a written language of their own and must use Basic.

**Example Names:** Bzhat, G'zharp, Kyrrik, J'kikrizt, T'karzhk, ytil.

**Adventurers:** Colicoids are rarely anything other than [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), although an enterprising Colicoid might find success as a [Scoundrel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel), [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout), or [Bounty Hunter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty_Hunter). No Colicoid Force-users are known to exist.
### Colicoid Species Traits
Colicoids share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Colicoids receive +2 bonuses to both their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Colicoids are infamously conniving individuals, whose lack of empathy put them at odds with the greater galaxy.

- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Colicoids have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

- **Speed:** Colicoids have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Defensive Ball:** When threatened or attacked, a Colicoid can curl itself up into a tight ball, protecting its vital organs and exposing its tough chitinous carapace. Rolling into a ball is a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) and grants the Colicoid a +5 bonus to its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold).
    - Once in a ball, the Colicoid cannot take any [Standard Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Actions) and can grasp only a single Small object (such as a [Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Comlink)). The Colicoid cannot see while curled up but listens and smells without hindrance. As a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), the Colicoid can rapidly unroll into a full standing position.

- **Force Resistance:** A Colicoid's alien physiology makes them resistant to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Colicoids receive a +5 bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against any use of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill.

- **Automatic Languages:** All Colicoids can speak Colicoid. They have no written form of their language.
