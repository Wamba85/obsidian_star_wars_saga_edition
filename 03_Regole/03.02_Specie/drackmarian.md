Drackmarians are reptilian humanoids from [Drackmar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Drackmar) in the Quelii Sector of [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim). They are a matriarchal warrior Species recognizable by their tails, large sharp teeth, colorful spotted scales, dorsal spikes running from the top of their head to their tail and along their shoulders, and the breathing apparatus they must wear when away from the methane atmosphere of [Drackmar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Drackmar). They are known for their generosity and are not easily coerced. They do not require sleep in the technical sense of the term, but rather need only to rest for four hours each night in a lethargic state, during which they are fully aware of their surroundings.

Sometime between one to three thousand years before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), the Republic classified the planet [Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir) as part of the Quelii Sector, territory held by Drackmarian warlords, though the Drackmarians held little real interest in the planet. During the Galactic Civil War, the Drackmarians were fearless opponents of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire). After regaining control of the Quelii Sector, the Drackmarians were once again driven out by Warlord Zsinj. The Drackmarians are only loosely allied with [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), with the [Morseerians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Morseerians) acting as a client Species.
