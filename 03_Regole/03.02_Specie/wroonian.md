Wroonians are a blue-skinned Species of [Near-Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Near-Humans) from the planet [Wroona](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wroona) in [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Inner_Rim), a world in the same sector as the Bestine System. Wroonian society is wealthy, fun-loving, and deeply spiritual; as a result, Wroonians often wear ornate clothing and tattoos. Wroonians love travel both at sea and in space, often fancying themselves as skilled navigators and explorers. A well-traveled Species, they were represented in [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Galactic_Republic) by the blue-skinned [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/pantoran.md|Pantoran]] Senator Chi Eekway Papanoida and later became part of [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Galactic_Empire). There are numerous Wroonian colonies spread throughout the Mid and Outer Rim, such as on [Saleucami](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saleucami).

Wroonian society is based upon the desire for personal wealth and material possessions. Despite this, they are a carefree and mellow Species that enjoy taking risks and living for the moment. Wroonians distrust all types of authority, thanks in part to their planetary government's near-constant instability. 

### Wroonian Characteristics
**Personality:** Wroonians are a boisterous people, often adventuring just to brag to their fellow Wroonians at its conclusion, and overexaggerating their importance and courage. While not bragging however, Wroonians become far more charming and friendly, and are known to liven up any social party with their wit and charisma.

**Physical Description:** Wroonians are humanoid in shape, differing from [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) only through their blue skin and yellow eyes. This coloration causes them to be confused with the similarly blue-skinned [Pantorans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pantorans), a misunderstanding not helped by their representation in the senate by a [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/pantoran.md|Pantoran]] senator.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Wroonian stands 1.8 meters tall and weighs 70 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Wroonians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-14 Years | 15-54 Years | 55-69 Years | 70-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld:** While the Wroonians possess several colonies throughout the galaxy, they originally hail from the economic world of [Wroona](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wroona), located in [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim) and connecting to Keller's Void Hyperspace Shortcut.

**Languages:** Wroonians speak their own language of high consonants and drawn-out vowels, and their wanderlust causes most to learn Basic at a young age.

**Example Names:** Fillio Androu, Azoora, Dasha Defano, Tis Dolan, Drixar, T'Charek Haathi, Nell Indigo, Llitishi, Linx Mallicker, Fume Pachoola, Pelf Pachoola, Kabalard Vinne, Iona Wince.

**Adventurers:** To a Wroonian, life is worth living only if you are having fun while getting rich. This philosophy carries over to a Wroonian's career choice, with most becoming [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), while the rare Force-sensitives become  [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigy). Their dislike of authority causes the Wroonians to have a minimal presence as [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) or [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) in the galaxy, regardless of era.
