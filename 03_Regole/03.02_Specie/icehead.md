Iceheads are the most commonly encountered (relatively speaking) members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) in the snowy mountains of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor). While normally working with their neighboring [Frostsprites](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Frostsprites), the most respected role to these people is to serve directly in the court of the Snow King. Stalwart and meticulous guards, Iceheads are a prideful bunch that view their duties as important definitions of their lives. With a careful cunning only sometimes undermined by their stubborness to tradition, Iceheads can be a great danger to any that upset their lieges.

### Icehead Characteristics

**Physical Description:** Iceheads appear as black humanoids with three-clawed hands and two legs that thicken to pointed feet. Their heads resemble blocks of ice, colored white and shaped like a thin rectangular prism, with thinner sides.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Iceheads age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |

**Languages:** Rimese is a shared language amongst [Frostsprites](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Frostsprites), Iceheads, and [Ice Demons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Demons). It carries sharp tones that cut through the high winds of their homes.

**Example Names:** Duty-la, Gracious-me, Strong-oh, Wise-so.
