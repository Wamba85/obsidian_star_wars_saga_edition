*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Species*

The Nediji are descended from avians on their homeworld of [Nedij](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nedij), where they dwell in eyeries tucked in craggy peaks. They are still very influenced by the instincts of their ancestors, and still hunt the same rath-scurriers their ancestors lived off of. They are organized into flocks, led by a patriarch. Men have many wives, a status symbol among their people. Of course, not much is known by the galaxy at large about the Nediji because they very rarely leave the planet, and do not tolerate visitors. The only Nediji off-world are those disowned by their people, and outcast to the rest of the galaxy. As such, most Nediji in the galaxy tend to be criminals or other members of the underworld. Those who know of them consider them to be fast, ruthless and clever, in that order.

**Physical Description:** Nediji are humanoids with obvious avian ancestry. Their plumage has devolved down into a very light, soft down that can nearly be mistaken for fur, most often in bright shades of blues and purples with darker coloration along the throat.

**Languages:** Nediji speak and read Nedij. Nediji voices are soothing and melodious.

### Nediji Species Traits
Nediji share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Nediji receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution).  Though gifted with incredible reflexes, Nediji bodies are exceptionally fragile.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Nediji have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Nediji have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Darkvision:** Nediji ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (including [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness. However, they cannot perceive colors in total darkness.
    - Additionally, a Nediji's eyes reduce the range penalties on [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks to -2 for every 10 squares of distance (instead of -5 for every 10 squares of distance).
- **Intuitive Initiative:** Nediji have incredible reaction time and are capable of great bursts of speed. A Nediji may choose to reroll any [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Soothing Pheromones:** A Nediji gains a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus on [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to [Change Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Change_Attitude). This bonus does not apply to other Nediji, as Nediji are acclimated to each other's pheromones.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Nediji can speak, read, and write Nedij.
