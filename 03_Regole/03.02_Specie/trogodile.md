*Trogodile Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Trogodiles are cave-dwelling, sentient crocodylomorphs indigenous to [Rattatak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rattatak). Tribes of Trogodiles can be found patrolling the pitch-black underground caverns and waterways of [Rattatak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rattatak), or locked up in [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/rattataki.md|Rattataki]] prison pits, awaiting trial-by-combat. The Trogodiles are used to warring with the surface-dwellers, and show no mercy to outsiders lost in their mazelike domain.

The Trogodiles were driven underground long ago, perhaps by the planet's changing climate and declining biosphere, or perhaps by a long-forgotten campaign of Rattatak's endless war. Whatever the cause, the Trogodiles have accepted the underground as their home, though this has not blunted their taste for vengeance and bloodshed.

It is unclear whether the Trogodiles are as prone to infighting as their surface-dwelling neighbours, but Trogodile raids and skirmishes with [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/rattataki.md|Rattataki]] settlements are commonplace, proving them a violent force to be reckoned with regardless.
### Trogodile Characteristics
**Personality:** In many ways, the Trogodiles are much like their neighbours the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/rattataki.md|Rattataki]]. Centuries of constant warfare on [Rattatak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rattatak) have led to a "survival of the fittest" mentality and a proud tradition of assassins and gladiators.

**Physical Description:** Trogodiles are large, reptilian creatures with protruding jaws, clawed appendages, and a spiny ridge running down their back. Their scaled skin tends to be colored in shades of brown, yellowish, or green.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Trogodiles age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 Years | 3-15 Years | 16-30 Years | 31-40 Years | 41-60 Years | 61+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The small, red world of [Rattatak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rattatak), floating in the far Outer Rim like a drop of blood. The planet is so remote that it remained undiscovered by the Republic, and the Trogodiles evolved without the guidance or influence of other galactic forces.

**Language:** Trogodiles speak their own language of Trogodile, and learn Rattataki during childhood. It is rare for a Trogodile to be well-traveled enough to learn Basic.

**Example Names:** Aa'q-Aa, Dyy'v-Ee, Ryy'v-Aa, Spyy'r-Aa, Swyy'm-Ee.

**Adventurers:** Trogodile adventurers are very similar to [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/rattataki.md|Rattataki]] adventurers. They are always warriors in some sense or another, almost exclusively as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) or the occasional [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout), and many go on to become [Gladiators](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gladiators) or [Bounty Hunters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty_Hunters). Those that survive above-ground often become [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Outlaws](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outlaws), trying to keep a low profile among the surface-dwellers.
### Trogodile Species Traits
