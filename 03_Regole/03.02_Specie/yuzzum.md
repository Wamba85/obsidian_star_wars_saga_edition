*Yuzzum Species data created by Wikia users Chellewalker, Darthauthor, and Droidscotty (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

Primitive hunter-gatherers, Yuzzums employ spears and traps for hunting and defense, and they lack industrial technology. While their neighbors, the [Ewoks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ewoks), live in the trees of Endor's Forest Moon, Yuzzums occupy the forest floor, where they hunt for ruggers (small, delicious rodents). 

Because their language is based on song, Yuzzums have highly developed vocal cords and keen ears. When provided with a patient tutor, they can learn to sing in other languages. Most of the few Yuzzums who have left the Forest Moon are performers. Among them are Joh Yowza, who plies [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim) with the Max Rebo Band during [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era) and "Fugitive" Fod, an outlaw singer working for the Corporate Sector during [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era).
### Yuzzum Characteristics
**Personality:** These furry beings are more savage than their [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ewok.md|Ewok]] neighbors, but their primitive and barbaric society belies great curiosity and cunning. Yuzzums are mindful, however, and get along well with outsiders who respect their beliefs and their territorial rights.

**Physical Description:** Yuzzums vary in appearance from tribe to tribe. Some Yuzzums display fangs and thick coats of hair, while others have blunt teeth and sparse fur. Their common traits include a round body supported by a pair of long, thin, stiltlike legs. They stand between 1.4 and 2 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Yuzzums age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-3 Years | 4-8 Years | 9-25 Years | 26-40 Years | 41-52 Years | 53+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Language:** Yuzzums speak their own language, which is based on song and bears no written alphabet.

**Example Names:** Bur, Fod, Joh Yowza, Lub, Mudi, Shy Loba.

**Adventurers:** Yuzzums removed from the primitive society on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor) survive in the galaxy as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) and, to a lesser extent, [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers). Yuzzums make poor [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), and few of them are sensitive to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).
### Yuzzum Species Traits
Yuzzums share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Yuzzums receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). Yuzzums are flexible but lack much muscle mass.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Yuzzums have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Yuzzums have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** Yuzzums are skilled foragers. A Yuzzum with [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Survival)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Survival)) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Primitive:** Yuzzums do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Rage:** Once per day, a Yuzzum can fly into a Rage as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). While Raging, the Yuzzum temporarily gains a +2 Rage bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls, but cannot use [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) that require patience and concentration, such as [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics), [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth), or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force). A fit of Rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the Yuzzum's [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
    - At the end of its Rage, the Yuzzum moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). The penalties imposed by this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) persist until the Yuzzum takes at least 10 minutes to recuperate, during which time the Yuzzum can't engage in any strenuous activity.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Yuzzums can speak Yuzzum. They have no written form of their language.
