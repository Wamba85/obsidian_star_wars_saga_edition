Qwohog, or "Wavedancers," are small, lithe, amphibian humanoids who normally dwell in freshwater streams, rivers, and lakes, although they are equally comfortable on land. Rebel scouts discovered these graceful swimmers while exploring the Qwohog homeworld for valuable crystal deposits and in short order the Qwohog communities opened trade negotiations with the offworld visitors. Imperial spies learned of the Rebels’ discovery and seized control of the planet's crystal-mining operations. The Qwohog offered no resistance, glumly allowing the Empire to plunder and ravage their world.When the Imperials finally withdrew after the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), Rebel scouts returned to assess the damage, protect the Qwohog homeworld from further aggression, and determine the fate of several Rebel agents stranded on the planet during the Imperial occupation. [The Rebel Alliance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebel_Alliance) established a permanent base on the planet, and since then thousands of Qwohog have found their way offworld aboard Alliance ships. Qwohog leaders orchestrated the colonization of other habitable worlds to ensure the continuation of the Species. During [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era), thriving Qwohog colonies existed throughout the galaxy.

Although technologically primitive the Qwohog quickly assimilated galactic technology into their society and are quite comfortable trading with peaceful yet technologically advanced offworlders. The Qwohog offer food, durable plant-based textiles, shells, natural healing balms, and other medicinal products. On their homeworld, the Qwohog wear light garments made from native plants, Offworld Wavedancers substitute garb made from other plants or manufactured by local companies,

Qwohog physiology is attuned to fresh water and Wavedancers cannot exist in salt water for long before the water's salinity burns their gill slits and damages their lungs. They converse by sending sound waves through the water, but on land they rely on a unique sign language or [Vocalizer Masks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vocalizer_Masks) (Similar to those used by the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/anomid.md|Anomids]]) that transform sound waves and subtle jaw movements into words.

### Qwohog Characteristics
**Personality:** Qwohog work and play hard, dividing their energies equally between survival and pleasure, Although Wavedancers draw strength and inspiration from their communities, many are lured from their horneworld by a sense of wanderlust and a desire to explore the unknown. Although very trusting and eager to make friends, a Qwohog can display startling ferocity when wronged.

**Physical Description:** Qwohog have smooth skin, scales instead of hair, black eyes, and a slim yet muscular frame. Raised silvery scales grow atop their heads and ring their wrists, waists, and ankles. Rows of gill slits under their arms circulate water through their lung cavities; out of water, the gill slits are nearly undetectable,

Qwohog do not have noses and detect scents with a ridge of sensitive skin above their mouths, their ears are long and pointed, and leaders often decorate their ears with shell fragments to show their station within the Wavedancer community. The average Qwohog adult stands 1.2 meters tall.

**Languages:** Qwohog use sound waves to communicate underwater. ln air, these sound waves can only be heard out to a range of 4 meters, and various devices are needed to translate the sound waves to words. The Qwohog also use sign language to communicate out of the water over a distance. This native sign language has been replaced by Basic but is still part of the Qwohog's heritage.
