*Tchuukthai Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology Web Enhancement counterpart).*

For centuries, the Tchuukthai were considered little more than beasts. Their brutish appearance and vocabulary of grunts and growls helped perpetuate that myth- a misperception the Tchuukthai were more than happy to see thrive. Over several centuries, Tchuukthai were discovered more than once. Most times, explorers avoided contact with these seemingly dangerous creatures. The few who couldn't resist the urge to learn more about them were met with vicious snarls and displays of ferocity.

Their true intelligence remained a secret until a Jedi Master whose name is lost in antiquity, explained much about the galaxy to a Tchuukthai he'd befriended. The Tchuukthai's interest was piqued, but he was wary of leaving his home and fearful that his people would be exploited if their true nature were known. The Jedi gave his word that he would protect their secret and offered to train the Tchuukthai in the ways of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). This Tchuukthai later became Jedi Master Thon of [Ambria](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ambria).

For thousands of years, Master Thon was the only Tchuukthai who had ventured into the galaxy. Only the Jedi knew his true nature. Since that time, other Tchuukthai might have ventured beyond their home system, perhaps even as pets or zoological exhibits. During the time of [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), their existence is still considered a rumor across most of the galaxy.
