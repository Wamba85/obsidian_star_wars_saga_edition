Togrutas are natives of the planet [Shili](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shili), a world of dense forests, wild scublands, and ever-growing urban areas. The most striking features of Togruta are their brightly colored horns, head, head-tails, and skin. These patterns serve as a sort of camouflage that helps them stalk prey through the red and white, meter-tall turu-grass of the scrublands.

Togrutas are natural pack hunters and work effectively in large groups. Individualism is generally discouraged, but despite this fact, most Togruta leaders gain power and prestige through expressions of individuality.

Outsiders often believe that Togrutas are venomous. Although no one knows how the rumor was started, Togrutas do use their sharp incisors to kill one of their favorite meals, the small, rodentlike [Thimiars](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thimiars).
