*Nazzar Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Nazzar are a bipedal Species native to the planet [Nazzri](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nazzri). Although Nazzar tend to be physically agile and powerful, the Species has a long history of contemplation and philosophy. They also tend to be xenophobic, making them uncommon off their homeworld.The Nazzri System was accepted into [The Old Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic) early in galactic history, but had very little contact beyond maintaining a senatorial presence and sending official communications. The Nazzar government spread to cover three nearby systems, than gradually shifted from a pure monarchy to a religious oligarchy. Throughout the early [Eras of Play](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Eras_of_Play) ([The Old Republic Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic_Era), [The Rise of the Empire Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Empire_Era), and [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era)), the Nazzar government supports strict adherence to the tenets of the fourteen sects of Ulizra, their state religion. These tenets include the concepts that outsiders are likely to taint Nazzar culture, that all philosophic systems in disagreement with Ulizra must be destroyed, and that a group is always of greater importance than an individual. These beliefs make it difficult for other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) to open trade relations with the Nazzar, or even for the Nazzar to retain cordial relations with most other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). Although it is legal for outsiders to stay in Nazzar systems, they generally find their welcome less than friendly.

Nazzar encountered off their homeworld generally fall into one of two categories: outcasts who have rejected the teachings of Ulizra, and preachers who seek to bring their philosophical truths to a new people. Nazzar outcasts find new organizations to follow, and many have become fanatical followers of fringe groups. Nazzar preachers find little acceptance for Ulizra outside their home systems and soon give up their missions. Very rarely, a citizen in good standing with the Nazzar religion might leave the planet on a *Boqeri*, a kind of self-imposed exile taken to seek spiritual truth. The length of a Boqeri depends on how long it takes the seeker to find the truth they lacked at home. Many Nazzar on these journeys discover the galaxy far too interesting a place to ever return home.

When the Emperor came into power, most Nazzar simply returned to their home systems and ignored the galaxy at large. This attitude persists into [The New Jedi Order Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Jedi_Order_Era). [Nazzri](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nazzri) has yet to accept invitations to become part of [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic). If the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] threat passes [Nazzri](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nazzri), the Nazzar may well continue to ignore the events of the universe around them.
