Balosars are humanoids with a shady reputation throughout the [Core Worlds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_Worlds). They can easily pass for [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] (when their antennapalps are retracted) and tend to live among the lowest echelons of society, preying on the vices of the weak-willed or impoverished.

Relief agencies have been trying to end the vicious circle of poverty, pollution, and corruption on [Balosar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Balosar_(Planet)) for years, but the planet's government offers little assistance. Offworld corporations regularly line Balosar bureaucrats' pockets with credits in exchange for state-owned real estate on which they build sweatshop factories. [Balosar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Balosar_(Planet)) offers no shortage of manual labor.

### Balosar Characteristics
**Personality:** Balosars are often weak-willed and self-absorbed. Many suffer from severe depression and feel like they're trapped; others grudgingly accept their lot in life with a sarcastic grin. A Balosar's moral and ethical outlook is often skewed by hard life experiences, and many have trouble distinguishing between right and wrong.

**Physical Description:** A Balosar has coarse hair, a frail-looking frame, and retractable antennapalps atop their heads. The average Balosar stands about 1.6 meters tall, and most have sickly complexions from a lack of sunlight and clean air.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Balosar stands 1.6 meters tall and weighs 70 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Balosars age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 Years | 13-15 Years | 16-39 Years | 40-52 Years | 53-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Balosar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Balosar_(Planet)) is an inhospitable [Core World](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Core_World) that has seen better days. The planet's high crime rate and corrupt government discourages tourists, and the air is barely breathable because of industrial pollution.

**Languages:** Balosars speak their own language, which consists of deep vocalizations and throaty rasps. Written Balosar is crude looking, but is no less complex than written Basic.

**Example Names:** Veya Bar'jaraka, Nina Dar'Eboros, Elan Sleazebaggano, Zirk Mer'darro.

**Adventurers:** Although crime runs rampant on [Balosar](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Balosar_(Planet)), the Species' tendency toward criminal activities has more to do with the deplorable conditions of the planet than any biological imperative. Many Balosars leave their homeworld in search of a better life, only to find life on other planets equally harsh. A Balosar hero can belong to any [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class).
