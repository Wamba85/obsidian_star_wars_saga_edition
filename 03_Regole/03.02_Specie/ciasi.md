*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Species Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Species_Sourcebook)*

The Ciasi are the native, bipedal, digitigrade, rodent-like Species of [Tund](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tund). The Ciasi traverse their world on the branches of the trees of the rainforests and prairies, allowing them to quickly travel without the need for advanced technology. Ciasi have elongated legs and feet allowing them to move with a hopping motion. Ciasi place great emphasis on attention to detail, a character trait that often earns them the reputation of being aloof.

The Ciasi are a moribund Species. At some point, presumably within three decades before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), Rokur Gepta, the last Sorcerer of Tund, destroyed the planet and all life on it, with his Electromagnetic Torpedo, leaving behind nothing more than a desolate wasteland full of deadly radiation (except some places where the radiation was held in check by force fields, though even there it would take billions of years for life to grow again). Presumably, the only Cias to have survived were those off-world when the cataclysm occurred. Hence, during the Clone Wars and thereafter, Ciasi are all but extinct.
