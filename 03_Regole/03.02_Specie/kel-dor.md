The Kel Dor evolved on [Dorin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dorin), a world with an atmosphere consisting mostly of helium and a gas that is unique to that world. As such, Kel Dor cannot breathe on planets with common nitrogen/oxygen atmospheres. Conversely, Dorin's atmosphere is toxic to most nonnative life.

On other planets, Kel Dor dwellings provide their native atmosphere (stored in large tanks). When outside, Kel Dor must wear breath masks and goggles. They can neither see nor breathe without these devices. Most Kel Dor breath masks include vocoders that amplify the wearer's speech; while their vocal cords function normally in their native atmosphere, Kel Dor must shout to provide sound in other environments. Their eyesight however, is enhanced when they are away from [Dorin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dorin).

### Kel Dor Species Traits
Kel Dor share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Kel Dor receive a +2 bonus to both their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) and [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Kel Dor are quick and wise, but they suffer from weaker constitutions than others.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Kel Dor have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Kel Dor have a base speed of 6 squares.

Without an Antiox Breath Mask, a Kel Dor begins to [Suffocate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Suffocate). A replacement mask costs 2,000 credits (500 on [Dorin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dorin)), and a year's supply of filters costs 200 credits (50 on [Dorin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dorin)). Kel Dor characters begin play with these items at no cost.
    - An Antiox Breath Mask is poisonous to other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
