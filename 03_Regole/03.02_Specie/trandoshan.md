The reptilian Trandoshans are known for their great strength, and warlike natures. Many of these beings dedicate themselves to martial training, and some follow the path of the hunter on their native world. A few have even become renowned (or infamous) bounty hunters in galactic society. Trandoshans have a long-standing enmity with [Wookiees](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wookiees), and the two [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) have fought often over the centuries.

Trandoshans (who refer to themselves as "T'doshok") have supersensitive eyes that can see into the infrared range. They shed their skin several times in the span of their lives and can even regenerate lost limbs, but their clawed hands have difficulty with fine manipulation of objects.
