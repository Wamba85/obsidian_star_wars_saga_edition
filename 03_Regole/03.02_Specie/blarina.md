*Blarina Species data created by unknown Wikia user.*

The Blarina are a short statured Species native to [Rina Major](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rina_Major), who are notably fond of language and are famously accomplished liars. While not especially strong, they more than make up for it with incredibly quick reflexes, rugged bodies, and resourceful minds. With tough skin, Blarina are capable of surviving in both high and low temperature extremes and through decompression, while also resistant to poisons and diseases. 

While not especially known for their hospitality, Blarina are still known to sympathize with others, and willing to offer stranded beings transport to civilization. Blarina stick together when faced with [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) of larger size, often forming family-based guilds or mercantile associations.
