The Gungans are omnivorous humanoids native to the swamps of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo). Technologically advanced, they rely mostly on biotech, growing instead of building their homes and production facilities.

While their culture is peaceful, it evolved from a series of long, bloody clan wars, and Gungans still admire strength and cunning. Most communities are devoted to farming or manufacturing goods that are then traded to other Gungan settlements, but they will reluctantly trade with the [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo).

### Gungan Characteristics
**Personality:** Gungans tend to be inquisitive, cautious, and suspicious.

**Physical Description:** Gungans range from 1.6 to 2 meters tall, with two eyestalks, floppy ears, and long tongues.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Gungan stands at 1.8 meters tall and weighs 70 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Gungans age at the following stages:

Since the treaty with the [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) of [Naboo](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo), some Gungans- perhaps driven by an impulse to regain the warrior spirit of old as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers)- have taken a larger step into galactic society.
