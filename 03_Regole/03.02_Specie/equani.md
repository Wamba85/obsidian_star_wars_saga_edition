*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Species*

The Equani are a very large Species evolved from predators on their homeworld of [Equanus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equanus). Though most Equani appear incredibly large and fierce, they tend to be gentle-souled beings more interested in high culture. As a species, they are incredibly adept at sensing emotions, and many put this ability to work in various fields such as psychology. Unfortunately, just before the Clone Wars, a mysterious solar flare incinerated all life on [Equanus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equanus), leaving the Species represented by only the few thousand Equani that were off-world at the time. The Species’ extinction is considered imminent, and in the wake of the Clone Wars’ eruption, many theories have surfaced regarding the destruction of the empathic Species; ranging from Republic super-laser weapon tests to a number of other conspiracy theories.

### Equani Characteristics

**Personality:** Equani are usually reserved, compassionate and understanding toward others. They are excellent listeners and well known for dispensing good advice, traits that make them excellent minders, or psychologists. 

**Physical Description:** Equani, while only around two meters tall, are incredibly large-bodied. Their bulk is covered in short-pale fur ranging from browns to blondes and grays. Their eyes are very large, and always match the color of their fur. Their mouths are also large, filled with double-rows of sharp teeth. Their hands end in four fingers with small claws. 

**Average Height/Weight: **A typical Equani stands at 2 meters tall and weighs about 100 kilograms. 

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Equanis age at the following stages:

**Homeworld:** The original home of the Equani was [Equanus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equanus), a planet in the Nharl System. It was scorched by a solar flare, believed to have been caused when the Republic tested a new superlaser. The only living Equani are those who were off-world at the time.

**Languages:** Equani speak and read Basic. Equani voices are low and smooth, considered very calming.

**Example Names:** Klo Merit, Roni Kath, Tuan Ko.

While there is not a strong tradition of Equani [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi), all Equani are incredibly empathic and open to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).
