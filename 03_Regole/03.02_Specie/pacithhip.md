*Pacithhip Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

The Pacithhip are humanoid pachyderms whose society is split into three castes: the scholar caste, the warrior caste, and the farmer caste. The shape of a Pacithhip tusks determines which caste it belongs to. The tusks do not achieve their final size and shape until adulthood and which point there's no disputing whether Pacithhlp will be a scholar, warrior, or farmer. 

Scholars interpret the law and educate the young. Warriors enforce the law and defend Pacithhip communities. Farmers traditionally provided food and clothing, but their role has expanded to include the manufacture of Vehicles, Droids and weapons. 

When Imperial scouts first arrived on the Pacithhip homeworld, the Pacithhip hadn't yet developed [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) technology, fusion power, or repulsorlift technology. Pacithhip had just mastered fossil fuels and precision machinery on their own and were easily subjugated by the Empire. After the Battle of [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor), Pacithhip took over the deserted Imperial facilities on their homeworld and began to import standard technology. Shortly after the formation of [The New Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_New_Republic), Pacithhip were common sights throughout the galaxy.
