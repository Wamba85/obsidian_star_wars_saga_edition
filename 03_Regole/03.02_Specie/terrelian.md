*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Criminals*

Blue-skinned humanoids from the once idyllic world of [Terellia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Terellia), the local Terrelian Jango Jumpers were long ago conquered for use as gladiators. Many can be found as slaves throughout [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim), in gladiator pits, or eking out a meager existence in the cracks and hollows of society. Natural athletes, it isn't uncommon for a Terrelian to be mistaken as Force-sensitive. Their long limbs and compact muscles allow the Species to leap great distances and sprint for extended periods of time.
### Terrelian Characteristics
**Personality:** After the exploitation of their homeworld, most Terrelians have become jaded and untrusting of others. Even those closest to a Terrelian are held at arm's length, making them sullenly isolationists.

**Physical Description:** Dark turquoise humanoids, a Terrelian is identifiable by their long lanky bodies and fiery red hair. Lighter blue coloration covers most of their faces, giving them a deathly visage. A Terrelian's eyes range in color from light purple to dark red.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Terrelians age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-15 Years | 16-37 Years | 38-54 Years | 55-64 Years | 65+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Terrelia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Terrelia), a formerly idyllic [Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inner_Rim) world now occupied by mining guilds and slaver gangs.

**Languages:** Terrelians speak Basic to communicate with others. Whatever language they once spoke on [Terrelia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Terrelia) has been lost to all but the most dedicated scholars.

**Example Names:** Cassie Cryar, Jango, Lika, Piolia.

**Adventurers:** Most Terrelians are fringers, living as [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) in the edges of society. Some instead make use of their natural athleticism and work as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts), or even more rarely, [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers).
### Terrelian Species Traits
Terrelians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Terrelians receive a +2 bonus to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Terrelians are agile and athletic, but anti-social to others.
