*Tiss'shar Species data created by Wikia user Droidscotty (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

Tiss'shar are bipedal reptilians who evolved from a predatory animal species native to their homeworld. At first glance, one would never suspect that the Tiss'shar were anything more than fierce beasts. Their appearance belies a keen intellect, but not all Tiss'shar have allowed modern civilization to dull their predatory instincts. While Tiss'shar are known across the galaxy as resourceful entrepreneurs, the Species also leads the field in expert assassins.

Tiss'shar corporations are among the galaxy's leading developers of technology, producing [Hyperdrives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrives), [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids), and all types of modem weaponry. Tiss'shar traders ply all of the major space routes, and Tiss'shar corporations aggressively search for new business opportunities and contracts throughout the known galaxy.

Tiss'shar who do not share in the love of financial gain through legitimate and shady business enterprises seek their fortunes as corporate or freelance assassins. Even the most cold-blooded Tiss'shar assassin still treats their work as a business and understands the importance of honoring a contract.
