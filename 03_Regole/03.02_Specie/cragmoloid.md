*Cragmoloid Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

A little-known Species hailing from the plains of [Ankus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ankus), Cragmoloids are a rare race. During [The Rebellion Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Rebellion_Era), most Cragmoloids seen are in Imperial work camps. A few joined the Rebellion, hoping to liberate their people. Despite their prodigious strength, few become mercenaries, as they find gratuitous violence distasteful.

Massively built and extremely powerful, Cragmoloids are physically intimidating, cumbersome, and irritable, but keenly aware of their surroundings.

### Cragmoloid Characteristics
**Personality:** An extremely proud and clan-oriented people, Cragmoloids sink into a deep despair if seperated from home, family, and friends. They are quick to anger and have a strong dislike for dishonesty and subterfuge. They prefer to be direct in their response to problems and thinks that those who resort to "Tricks" are dishonorable.

**Physical Description:** Cragmoloids resemble 3-meter-tall anthropomorphic elephants with tusks and thick, leathery hides. They have tiny red, beady eyes.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Cragmoloids age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-14 Years | 15-69 Years | 70-86 Years | 87-119 Years | 120+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Ankus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ankus), a rocky planet in [The Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Unknown_Regions) near [Ord Mantell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Mantell).

**Language:** Cragmoloids speak and read Cragii. Cragmoloids who leave their homeworld also learn to speak Basic.

**Example Names:** Akoom, Darak, Ormoj, Rooty, Urun, Vuula.

**Adventurers:** Cragmoloid adventurers are usually [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) or [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels). Despite an average number of Force-users among the Species, there are no known examples of Cragmoloid [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi).
### Cragmoloid Species Traits
Cragmoloids share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Cragmoloids suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Cragmoloids are large and strong, but often prone to bouts of anger.
- **Large Size:** As Large creatures, Cragmoloids take a -1 size penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a -5 size penalty on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks, and they gain a +5 size bonus to their [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). Their lifting and carrying limits are double those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Cragmoloids have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Impose Order:** Cragmoloids have a great distaste for dishonorable conduct, and strive to maintain proper societal order. Once per encounter, a Cragmoloid can spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to allow each ally within 12 squares to move up to half that ally's Speed as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
- **Physically Intimidating:** Cragmoloids use their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier instead of their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier for [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) others.
- **Rage:** Once per day, a Cragmoloid can fly into a Rage as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). While Raging, the Cragmoloid temporarily gains a +2 Rage bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls, but cannot use [Skills](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skills) that require patience and concentration, such as [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics), [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth), or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force). A fit of Rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the Cragmoloid's [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier.
    - At the end of its Rage, the Cragmoloid moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). The penalties imposed by this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) persist until the Cragmoloid takes at least 10 minutes to recuperate, during which time the Cragmoloid can't engage in any strenuous activity.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Cargmoloids can speak, read, and write Cragii.
