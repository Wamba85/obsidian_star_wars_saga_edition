*Swokes Swokes Species data created by Wikia user Darthauthor (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

Swokes Swokes seem like a throwback to a more primitive form of life. Although their society remains underdeveloped by galactic standards, they can easily hold their own against better-equipped enemies due to their unique physiology. Their simple bodies lack all but the most critical pain receptors, and they can regenerate lost limbs. These features make them nearly unstoppable in a fight.

### Swokes Swokes Characteristics
**Personality:** Swokes Swokes are properly recognized as ruthless bullies and contemptible tyrants who crave some combination of wealth, fame, and power. Most members of the Species are devoutly religious and, as such, wear small pouches that contain dried remains of their dead ancestors- usually fingers, gallstones, or teeth.

**Physical Description:** Swokes Swokes are bulky bipeds with nightmarish fanged faces, horned heads, lidless eyes, and rubbery skin that varies in hue from green-gray to glistening off-white. They stand 1.4 to 2 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Swokes Swokes age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-13 Years | 14-44 Years | 45-60 Years | 61-74 Years | 75+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Makem Te](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Makem_Te), located in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Languages:** Swoken, a harsh and guttural language with a crudely rendered alphabet.

**Example Names:** Chako Chako, Gragra, Kruke Kruke, Machug, Sorpaat, Wruuta Wruuta.

**Adventurers:** Swokes Swokes adventurers are typically [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) who find work as mercenaries, bodyguards, and bounty hunters. The few [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) that exist among the Species often advance to become [Crime Lords](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Crime_Lords) residing on other backwater worlds.
