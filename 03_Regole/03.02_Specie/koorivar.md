The Koorivar are well known for their domination of the Corporate Alliance leadership, a coalition of commercial interests that was allied with the Confederacy during the Clone Wars. The reptilian humanoids inhabit [Kooriva](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kooriva), a planet they leased from [The Old Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Republic) after leaving their original homeworld for unknown reasons. Eventually, they were able to gain enough Senate influence to own the planet outright, and gained full representation in the Republic Senate. The Koorivar are an ambitious people, always searching for wealth and fame, what they see as the two main paths to influence and power. This has made Koorivar ubiquitous throughout the galaxy, as it is common for adult Koorivar to strike out on their own to find their fortune amongst the stars. 

### Koorivar Characteristics

**Personality:** Koorivar are sly sentients who generally prefer manipulation over physical contest. They are miserly with their resources, and cautious to risk their own person. Conversely, they do enjoy the finer things in life, and spoil themselves with only the best garments and living conditions available. 

**Physical Description:** Humanoid reptilians with skin ranging in a variety of shades of reds and greens, Koorivars have a large, twisting horn atop their heads, which is always polished and featured in their dress. This horn is considered a status symbol among other Koorivar, and is the primary factor in how attractive Koorivar perceive each other on a physical level. Of course, a Koorivar’s accounts, power and influence far outweigh the importance of the size of their horn. 

**Average Height/Weight: **A typical Koorivar stands at 1.9 meters tall and weighs about 75 kilograms.
