Jokingly called "Hairless Wookiees" by the few who have seen them, Stereb have been found on a number of worlds with rocky crusts. Not technologically adept, the Stereb live in harmony with the surfaces of a planet, working elaborate stone passages underground in the belief that they're part of the world's circulatory system.
