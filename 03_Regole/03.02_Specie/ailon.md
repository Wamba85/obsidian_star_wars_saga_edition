Ailons are a warlike humanoid Species that hailed from [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim) planet of [Ailon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ailon_(planet)). They are known for their strict militaristic society and to consituite the entirety of [The Ailon Nova Guard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_The_Ailon_Nova_Guard), one of the most feared military units which fight for [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic).

### Ailon Characteristics
**Personality:** Ailons deeply respect might, boldness and military prowess, to the point that to them, military training is a form of religious devotion. Contemptous of other Species but aware that their martial valour alone is not enought to prevail against the far superior technology and resources of the Republic, the governments of [Ailon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ailon_(planet)) usually pledge the services of their military to the strongest faction in the Galaxy, shall it be [The Galactic Republic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Republic), [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) or even the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]].

**Physical Description:** Ailons are characterized by fit humanoid bodies and quick reflexes. Their faces feature two big eyes and a small snout, and these traits are reflexed in the suites of armour that Ailons don in battle. Ailons are known to have a high reproduction rate, though this is compensated by a high mortality rate due to constant military engagements and campaigns.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Ailon male or female stands at 1.9 meters tall and weights 85 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Ailons age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 Years | 11-13 Years | 14-50 Years | 51-62 Years | 63-79 Years | 80+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Ailons are native of [The Inner Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inner_Rim) planet of [Ailon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ailon_(planet)).

**Languages:** Ailons communicate with their own native language of Ailonese, and they learn to speak Basic as well.

**Adventurers:** most Ailons are enlisted in their planetary militia, in [The Ailon Nova Guard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/GaW_The_Ailon_Nova_Guard) or had their five-year mandatory military service completed, the vast majority of them as [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and some of them as [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts). Ailon [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) are usually [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) that climbed the military hierarchy, looking towards the [Officer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Officer) ranks or pursuing an administrative career. Ailons exiled or escaped from the oppressing militaristic society of their home planet may also be [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels). No Ailon Force-users are known to exist.
