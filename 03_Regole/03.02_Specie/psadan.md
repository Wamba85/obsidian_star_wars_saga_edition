The Psadans are natives of [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland), an unremarkable Outer Rim world that achieved some infamy when Emperor Palpatine selected it as the location for his secret base and depository.

Before the Empire's arrival, the Psadans were constantly at war with Wayland's other indigenous sentient Species, the [Myneyrshi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Myneyrshi). In an effort to resist Imperial enslavement, the Psadans and [Myneyrshi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Myneyrshi) joined forces to repel the Empire. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful and ultimately subjugated. Captured Psadans were put to work, carving out the Emperor's secret base under Mount Tantiss. Few Psadans possessed the brains or will to resist their Imperial oppressors. A few Psadans eluded capture and enslavement by retreating into the depths of Wayland's jungles, but they were ill equipped to mount any further resistance.

After the fall of the Empire and the destruction of the Emperor's base beneath Mount Tantiss, the Psadans and [Myneyrshi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Myneyrshi) enjoyed a short period of peace. When the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] arrived and constructed a base on [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland), the Psadans and [Myneyrshi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Myneyrshi) attempted to drive off the extragalactic invaders; again, their efforts met with failure. The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]] set about ridding the planet of the Psadan and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/myneyrsh.md|Myneyrsh]] "Vermin." Although a few Psadans were evacuated aboard Republic ships, most of the Species refused to leave. Like the [Myneyrshi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Myneyrshi), the future of the Psadan Species remains uncertain.

### Psadan Characteristics
**Personality:** Psadans are nature worshipers who enjoy hunting. Their religion dictates that no part of a slaughtered creature can go to waste. Their low intelligence makes them obstinate and often eager to fight. Despite being somewhat feeble-minded, Psadans have a high resistance to telepathic manipulation.

**Physical Description:** Psadans have large flat faces, short stocky legs, and rock-hard scales. Their backs are covered with a shell of thick armored plates, and they frequently adorn their bodies with skins and bones from creatures they've hunted. The average Psadan stands about 1.5 meters tall.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Psadans age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-13 Years | 14-54 Years | 55-74 Years | 75-89 Years | 90+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland), a remote jungle world in [The Outer Rim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim).

**Language:** Psadan is a guttural language of grunts, throaty groans, and deep vocalizations. There is no written form of the language. Psadans pass on knowledge through an oral history.

**Example Names:** Ba'han, Da'yid, Lupee, Parla, Rhev, Rsidd, Sinni, Sy'nir, Yaodi.

**Adventurers:** Psadans have little or no interest in exploring the galaxy. Very few Psadans seek to leave [Wayland](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wayland). Given their belligerent attitude, Wayland's remote location, and the presence of first the Empire then later the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/yuuzhan-vong.md|Yuuzhan Vong]], it's unlikely that Psadans will enjoy many opportunities to roam the galaxy. Psadan heroes are usually displaced or exiled members of the Species; they are most commonly [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout), or [Force Prodigies](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Prodigy).

### Psadan Species Traits

Psadans are brutish and strong, but their primitive society alienates them from the galaxy.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Psadans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Psadans have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Force Resistance: **Psadans receive a +5 bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against any use of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) Skill.

- **Primitive:** Psadans do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Classes) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Pasdans can speak both Myneyrsh and Psadan. They have no written form of their language.
