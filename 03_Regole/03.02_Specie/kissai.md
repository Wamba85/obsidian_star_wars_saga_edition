The [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]] and Kissai are two subspecies of the original Sith race of [Korriban](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban). The Kissai are the priests and spiritual leaders who indoctrinate their comrades in the teaching of [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith).

The Kissai are just as ruthless as the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]], but they are more intelligent and observant. Their strict cultural standards demand that they serve their masters well, a trait instilled in them by the Dark Jedi who first enslaved their Species. When the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]] and Kissai flee [Korriban](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Korriban) (well before the arrival of the eventual Sith Lords) to resettle on [Ziost](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ziost), the Kissai oversee the rebuilding efforts.

The Kissai serve The Sith directly, but the Sith Lord Naga Sadow has other ideas for the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]] caste. The Kissai are largely left on [Ziost](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ziost) as the servants of other Sith Lords, but Sadow uses [Sith Alchemy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Alchemy) to transform the [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]] into his hulking, brutish soldiers. His [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/massassi.md|Massassi]] crews labor under his command on [Yavin 4](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin_4), building temples and providing the means for him to hide his ship and practice his dark arts. After Sadow's death, they become a primitive, tribal society worshiping one of Sadow's creations as a dark god.
