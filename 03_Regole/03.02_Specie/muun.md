*Muun Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Ultimate Alien Anthology counterpart).*

[Muunilinst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Muunilinst), the Muun homeworld, has been the financial center of the galaxy for millennia. When the Republic realized a need for a standard currency, the Muuns were a natural choice to spearhead it's distribution and handling. [Muunilinst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Muunilinst) is well defended and easily reached by Republic warships. The Muuns, for the most part, take their responsibility in stride.

When the Old Republic gave way to the Emperor's New Order, the Muuns were among the few non-[[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) left untouched. The Imperials conceded that no Species was better equipped to oversee the galactic economy, and they were unwilling to risk a financial reprisal. Imperial administrators were tasked with monitoring the Muuns to ensure that Imperial credits would not find their way into Rebel Alliance coffers, but the New Order had little to fear from the Muuns, whose unwavering integrity prohibited such devious conduct.
