Ithorians are tall humanoids whose appearance leads many to refer to them colloquially as "Hammerheads." Peaceful and gentle, Ithorians are widely recognized as talented artists, brilliant agricultural engineers, and skilled diplomats.

Ithorians are perhaps the greatest ecologists in the galaxy, devoting their technology to preserving the natural beauty of their homeworld's jungles. They live in "Herds," dwelling in cities that hover above the surface of their planet and striving to maintain the ecological balance in the "Mother Jungle."

Ithorians also travel the galaxy in massive "Herd Ships," masterpieces of environmental engineering that carry a perfect replica of their native jungle. Many look forward to trading for the exotic wares the Ithorians bring from distant planets.

**Physical Description:** Ithorians are humanoid, ranging in height from 1.8 to 2.3 meters tall, with long necks that curl forward and end in dome-shaped heads. They have two mouths, one on each side of their neck, producing a stereo effect when they talk.

### Ithorian Species Traits
Ithorians share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Ithorians receive a +2 bonus to both their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity). Ithorians are wise and deliberate thinkers, whose personable nature allows them to get along well with others, but they are not agile.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Ithorians have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Ithorians have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Bellow:** As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), an Ithorian can open all four of its throats and emit a terrible subsonic Bellow. The Ithorian makes a special attack roll (1d20 + its Character Level) and compares the result to the [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) of all creatures and unattended objects in a 6-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone). A successful hit deals 3d6 points of [Sonic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic) damage; if the attack misses, the target takes half damage instead.
    - Each use of this ability moves the Ithorian -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
    - An Ithorian can choose to add more dice (d6s) to the damage it deals with its Bellow, but each additional 1d6 of damage moves the Ithorian another -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
- **Conditional Bonus Feat:** Ithorians like to maintain close ties with nature. An Ithorian with [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)) as a [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) gains [Skill Focus (Knowledge (Life Sciences))](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Knowledge_(Life_Sciences))) as a bonus [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat).
- **Iron Will:** Ithorians have above-average willpower and gain a +2 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).
- **Survival Instinct:** An Ithorian may choose to reroll any [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) check, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Ithorians can speak, read, and write Basic and Ithorese.
