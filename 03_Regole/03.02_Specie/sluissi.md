Sluissi are pioneers of faster-than-light propulsion, having developed space travel before their first contact with [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/duros.md|Duros]] and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/human.md|Human]] explorers and the Old Republic. Their home planet of [Sluis Van](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sluis_Van) is known for centuries as an excellent shipyard. The Sluissi use their shipyards to reinforce and expand their contact with other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) and to maintain and improve their position within the Republic.

Sluissi [Technicians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technicians) are renowned for Starship construction and modification. Although Sluissi methods are slower than others, customers are willing to wait to own the best Starship technology available. The Sluissi consider Starship construction to be an art form. So respected are Sluissi shipyards that the slow pace of construction is tolerated by even the Empire, albeit impatiently.
