The long-lived Firrerreo are a people from the planet [Firrerre](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Firrerre). They resemble [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) but have a few differences to set them apart from others. Firrerreo have a nictitating membrane over their eyes, which helps them to see into the ultraviolet spectrum. Finally, their canine teeth are larger and more developed than [Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans). Firrerreo are known to heal more quickly than Humans.An interesting belief among the Firrerreo is that if a person knows another’s name, he or she has power over that Firrerreo by speaking their name. They call this concept “Owning the name,” and many take advantage of owning a name as often as they can. Firrerreo live in clans, and have little concern for people outside of their clan.

Before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), a Firrerreo named Hethrir and his mate became students of Darth Vader. He was eventually awarded the title Procurator of Justice and to prove his loyalty, he betrayed his own people, forcing many to be kidnapped for enslavement and murdering the rest. The imprisoned Firrerreo were discovered and rescued by efforts from Leia Organa-Solo. Those freed then settled on other worlds.
