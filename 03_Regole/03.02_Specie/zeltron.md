Zeltrons are known throughout the galaxy for their hedonistic nature. Experiencing pleasure in its myriad forms is the lifetime pursuit of all Zeltrons. They are a fun-loving species, placing recreation before other, less worldly interests. Members of the Species are found throughout the galaxy, for they enjoy traveling, meeting new people, indulging in their passions, and experiencing new things.

Zeltrons are born with a latent empathy that allows them to sense the emotions of others. Though not ruled by emotions of others, they can, over time, become inundated with negative feelings if they are surrounded by such sentiments for a prolonged period of time. For this reason, many Zeltrons are pacifistic, preferring peaceful negotiation to the destructive actions of combat. This is not to say that Zeltrons are incapable of defending themselves; their passion gives them a great capacity for violence when the situation warrants. Additionally, their physiology includes an ultra efficient metabolism which allows them to maintain peak body weight and muscle mass regardless of their culinary indulgences.

### Zeltron Characteristics

**Personality:** Zeltrons are almost universally friendly, jolly, and sociable. They love meeting and interacting with new people, visiting new places, and enjoying new experiences. They are benignly manipulative insofar as they strive to be uplifting.

Though their cheerful demeanor and easy smiles can make them seem flippant, Zeltrons can be very serious when the occasion demands it. They are especially concerned with the well-being of their friends and loved ones, and a sure-fire way to anger a Zeltron is to place his or her friends or family in danger.
