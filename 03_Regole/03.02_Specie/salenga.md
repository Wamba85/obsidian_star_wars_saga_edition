*Salenga Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

A visually striking species of pink-skinned sentients, Salenga thrive in urban environments and enjoy maintaining a large circle of social contacts.
### Salenga Characteristics
**Personality:** Salenga rarely view the word "manipulative" as a negative, and see nothing wrong with manipulating a situation to work in their favor. Salengas are good at putting one over on people, and getting inside people's heads.

Whilst the criminal applications of this philosophy are obvious, most Salenga apply it to respectable ends. Salenga adapt to new social environments with ease, their academics and lawyers are formidable debaters, and they are rarely so blunt as to reveal their true feelings if it would only serve to dampen others' mood.

**Physical Description:** Salenga have pink skin and yellow eyes with vertical eyelids and triangular pupils. Their hands have one thumb, one finger and a single wide appendage where humans and species with similar hand shapes have more fingers. These paddle-like hands are limited in dexterity, but prove useful when swimming. Salenga also have a flap of skin hanging below the back of their head which resembles long hair.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Salenga age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-7 Years | 8-15 Years | 16-40 Years | 41-60 Years | 61-70 Years | 71+ Years |
