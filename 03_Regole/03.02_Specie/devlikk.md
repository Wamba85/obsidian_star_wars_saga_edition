*Devlikk Species data created by Wikia user SunsetMage001.*

Devlikks are a flightless avian Species native to the planet [Ord Radama](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Radama), where they reside in cities laid out like enormous mazes. While offworlders find the configuration off-putting, Devlikks have little trouble navigating the passageways due to their innate magnetic sense. Devlikks live for an average of just 10 years, and age rapidly prior to that point. Although their bodies are only somewhat humanoid, Devlikks often make do with devices and furnishings aimed at taller species.

Following the defeat of the last remnants of [The Confederacy of Independent Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems), the Devlikks were subject to extreme poverty and discrimination under [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire).
### Devlikk Characteristics

**Personality:** Devlikks are gregarious and charismatic, though their mental faculties succumb quickly to age.

**Physical Description:** Devlikks have long necks, shoulders covered in green feathers, a small green tail, and oddly-shaped heads. While Devlikks operate comfortably without clothing, they sometimes dress in items such as goggles, tabards, chaps, bandoleers, or shirts. Another Devlikk fashion is to bind the hair of the cheeks into ponytails.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Devlikks age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Year | 2 Years | 3-5 Years | 6-7 Years | 8 Years | 9+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Ord Radama](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ord_Radama), a planet in the Radama Void of [The Outer Rim Territories](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Rim_Territories). Once a world of marshes and wetlands, it was built up with cities and streets over the years.

**Languages:** Devlikks speak their own langauge of Devlikk as well as Basic.

**Example Names:** Ceedo Rin, Lor Winbef, Naralla, Raido, Wan Sandage.

**Adventurers:** Devlikks often become and [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) and [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) due to their innate charm. Force-sensitive Devlikks are very rare, but by no means impossible.
### Devlikk Species Traits
Devlikks share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Devlikks receive a +2 bonus to both their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) and [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) and [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength). Devlikks have good reflexes and are often popular, but they lack phyical strength and their short lifespans limit their capacity for knowledge.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Devlikks gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Combat) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Devlikks have a base speed of 4 squares.
- **Energy Surge:** Once per encounter, a Devlikk can gain a temporary boost to quickness and reflexes. When this ability is activated as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), a Devlikk gains a +2 bonus on [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity)-based [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks), and increases its base speed to 8 squares.
    - The energy lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Devlikk's [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) modifier (minimum 1 round). When the energy is expended, the Devlikk moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
    - The penalties imposed by this condition persist until the Devlikk takes at least 10 minutes to recuperate, during which time the creature can't engage in any strenuous activity.
- **Natural Weapons:** A Devlikk has Natural Weapons, in the form of razor-sharp claws. When a Devlikk makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d4 points of Slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Devlikks are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Devlikks can speak, read, and write both Basic and Devlikk.
