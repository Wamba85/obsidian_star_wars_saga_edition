*Teek Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*
Teeks are rodentlike, simian creatures that live in the forest, scavenging and stealing things from animal nests and from [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/ewok.md|Ewok]] dwellings. The other members of [The Native Tribes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Native_Tribes) hold poor relations with the Teeks, considering it a sure sign of trouble even to be seen with one of the creatures. Teeks have evolved an enormously fast metabolism, which allows them to put on bursts of incredible speed, for fleeing both from enemies and from the victims of their own thievery.

### Teek Characteristics
**Personality:** Though Teeks are accomplished thieves and collectors of all kinds of things, they do not consider themselves dishonest, since they leave a trinket or token of equivalent value. What the Teek considers "equal value" is often very different from what the original owner of the stolen object might expect.

**Physical Description:** Teeks have long, pointy ears and scruffy white fur, beady black eyes, and a propensity for constant chattering. A set of buckteeth makes them look stupid and goatish, but their hands are agile and fast, amazingly so. Teeks wear rudimentary clothing, with many belts, pouches, and pockets for those items they manage to snatch.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Teeks age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-27 Years | 28-40 Years | 41-52 Years | 53+ Years |

**Homeworld:** Teeks are typically found on [The Forest Moon of Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forest_Moon_of_Endor), though records show that the Species is not native to the Endor System.

**Languages:** Teek is a rapid-fire chittering language, lacking any written form. Well-traveled Teeks might learn Ewokese or Dulok, but few on [Endor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endor) willingly associate with the creatures.

**Example Names:** Duuk, Kooj, Reet, Teek, Yeep.

**Adventurers:** Teeks are mischievous beings, often taking the role of [Scoundrel](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel) or [Scout](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout). Those that can work in groups struggle with a steep language barrier, but they make it up with their unexpected cunning. 

### Teek Species Traits
Teeks share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Teeks receive a +2 bonus toÂ their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma), but suffer a -2 penalty to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom). Teeks are surprisingly sociable, but are prone to poor decisions.
- **Small Size:** As Small creatures, Teeks gain a +1 size bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and a +5 size bonus on [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks. However, their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
- **Speed:** Teeks have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Acceleration:** When using the [Run](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Run) Action, Teeks may roll into a ball to move at greater speed. When [Running](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Running), Teeks may take a -5 penalty on [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks, and have their Speed doubled.
- **Bonus Class Skill:** A Teek treats the [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) skill as a Class Skill, regardless of [Heroic Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic_Class).
- **Primitive:** Teeks do not gain [Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Heavy_Weapons)), [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)), or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)) as starting [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) at first level, even if their [Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Class) normally grants them.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Teeks can speak Teek. They have no written form of their language.
