[The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times) are truly the Caamasi's darkest hours. Though they will not know it for decades to come, the Caamasi homeworld fell victim to one of the vilest plots of the new Emperor. Only a few months after the end of the Clone Wars, the Empire, with help from internal agents, hammered [Caamas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Caamas) in a devastating orbital bombardment. The world was effectively destroyed, along with the vast majority of the Caamasi people. Most of those who survived were offworld at the time. A few would return to investigate rehabilitating the planet, but most relocated to refugee camps on [Kerilt](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerilt), [Susevfl](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Susevfl), and [Alderaan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaan). [Kerilt](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerilt) and [Alderaan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaan) would eventually host large colonies of Caamasi.

All Caamasi can create vivid telepathic memories called *Memnii* (singular Memnis), which can be shared with others of their Species and with Force-users who possess at least a rudimentary command of telepathy. A Memnis is as vivid to the one who receives it as it is to the one who participated in the event remembered. Caamasi are driven to share *Memnii* as a form of collected history and ancestral wisdom. After the destruction of Caamas, *Memnii* take on even greater importance as the only way for young Caamasi to know their lost homeworld.

### Caamasi Characteristics
**Personality:** Caamasi possess great moral strength and a deep respect for others. They are artistic, freethinking, gentle, and contemplative. They are also well-known pacifists. 

**Physical Description:** A Caamasi's body is tall, lean, and covered in down. It has long arms with thin, three-fingered hands. The coloration of the downy coat is typically golden with purple rings around the eyes and three matching stripes on the tops of the head that extend to the shoulders. Less common colorations feature radically darker hues in the same patterns.

**Average Height/Weight:** A typical Caamasi stands 1.8 meters tall and weighs 80 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Caamasi age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-11 Years | 12-15 Years | 16-49 Years | 50-76 Years | 77-89 Years | 90+ Years |

**Homeworld:** The Core World of [Caamas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Caamas), prior to its devastation. The few survivors, along with Caamasi who were offworld at the time, migrated to [Kerilt](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kerilt) in the Algara System and also established a large colony on [Alderaan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaan) (before that planet too was destroyed). 

**Languages:** Caamasi speak, read, and write their language of Caamasi, as well as Basic.

**Example Names:** Elegos A'Kla, Ylenic It'kla, Releqy, Tegas Sulkec, Meqli Li karin.

**Adventurers:** As pacifists, Caamasi are never [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) or similarly aggressive character types. Heroic Caamasi are typically [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles), particularly diplomats. Prior to the rise of the Empire, those extremely rare Caamasi who are strong in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) might become [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) diplomats and consulars. During [The Dark Times](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Times), Caamasi Force-users conceal their abilities.

### Caamasi Species Traits
Caamasi share the following Species Traits:
- **Ability Modifiers:** All Caamasi receive a +4 bonus to their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), but suffer -2 penalties to both their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Caamasi are renowned for their insight, not their physical strength.
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Caamasi have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Caamasi have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Memory Sharing:** Caamasi can create strong, lasting memories and share them with others of their [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) through an inborn telepathy. Sharing a memory begins with taking a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to initiate the link between two adjacent Caamasi; transferring a memory requires as much time as the events being recalled. The recipient of a memory must be willing to receive it.
    - Experiencing *Memniis* not like receiving a photographic memory of those events, but rather a complete, immersive experience. Any character who receives a Memnis from a Caamasi always gains favorable circumstances on [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) checks related to that memory.
    - Force-using characters can also receive *Memnii* from a Caamasi with a successful DC 15 [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, made as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).
- **Pacifism:** As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), a Caamasi can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of a single target within line of sight. If the check is successful, the target moves -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) if it makes any attacks before the start of the Caamasi's next turn.
    - The target must be able to hear and understand the Caamasi for this ability to have any effect, and any single target can be affected only once at any given time (meaning that multiple Caamasi may not use this ability on the same target at the same time).
    - This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
- **Silver Tongued:** Caamasi are skilled negotiators, and patient consulars. A Caamasi can choose to reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check, using the better result.
- **Automatic Languages:** All Caamasi can speak, read, and write both Basic and Caamasi.
