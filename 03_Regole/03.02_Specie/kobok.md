*Kobok Species data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner) (Converted from its Geonosis and the Outer Rim Worlds counterpart).*

The Koboks are an uncommon Species with a penchant for mercenary work. For millennia, the Species kept to their homeworld [Koboth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Koboth) and outlying systems along the border of the Tingel Arm, warring among themselves until a planetary legislative body, the Koboth Union, was formed in the centuries before the Empire's rise. Though never members of the Republic, the Koboks did broker trade agreements with the nearby [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/trianii.md|Trianii]] colonies and the [Hiitian](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hiitian) clan aeries, and also engaged in minor disputes with the Corporate Alliance.

Approximately a decade before the Battle of [Yavin](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yavin), the Koboks became embroiled in a territorial dispute with the ever-expanding Corporate Alliance. This turn toward combat readiness prepared the Koboks for a number of skirmishes during the Mavvan Conflict, which engendered the creation of the Kobothi S-Corps, an elite unit of security forces charged with the protection of Kobothi Space and interests. The Mavvan Conflict has defined the Koboks' image as capable warriors.
### Kobok Characteristics
**Personality:** Koboks are largely perceived as cunning killers by the galactic population. Most who find employ in the galaxy further reinforce this notion. Koboks are a calculating people, bred to endure the hardships of their homeworld.

**Physical Description:** Koboks are thin, bipedal insectoids with carapaces that range from cream/beige to dark yellow and orange; some black and dark green Koboks also inhabit Koboth's lower Kuurok Peninsula. Koboks possess three eyes- two in the front of their head and one in the back. Their forearms and lower legs possess four envenomed claws, the poison of which can render victims unconscious. Koboks typically stand between 1.3 and 1.8 meters in height, but because of their lithe builds, they seldom weigh more than 60 kilograms.

**[Age Groups](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age_Groups):** Koboks age at the following stages:

| CHILD | YOUNG ADULT | ADULT | MIDDLE AGE | OLD | VENERABLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-8 Years | 9-16 Years | 17-40 Years | 41-65 Years | 66-75 Years | 76+ Years |

**Homeworld:** [Koboh](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Koboh), on the fringe of The Outer Rim Territories' Tingel Arm along the border of the Corporate Sector, is a solar flare-scoured world. The planet is orbited by three dead moons, which are also subjected to the tempestuous storms of Koba Prime. Corellian and Duro explorers first opened [Koboth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Koboth) to trade via spurs of the Hydian Way, centuries before the rise of the Empire. This contact, however, came some time after the Koboks had already developed intra-system and short-range interstellar travel, as well as their relations with the [Hiitians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hiitians) and [[03_Regole/03.02_Specie/trianii.md|Trianii]]. The planet is divided into six primary continents. Several rocky strings of islands also jut from the roiling seas of the southern hemisphere, which receives the most punishment from the sun.

**Languages:** Koboks speak and read Kobothi, a pitched, hissing language that does not translate well into Basic. In addition, some "Code" languages are known only to S-Corps agents and other secretive organizations. Researchers know very little of the languages or their nature.

**Example Names:** Gaff, Kasj, Koas, Tiska, Slis.

**Adventurers:** Though not very visible in the galaxy, most Koboks encountered serve in some military or quasimilitary function. As mercenaries, assassins, and general bonebreakers, the Koboks have earned something of a vicious reputation (Akin to that of [Rodians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rodians)). Force-users are rare (But not unheard of), [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scouts) are occasionally encountered, and [Soldiers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Soldiers) are the most commonly encountered Koboks off their homeworld.
### Kobok Species Traits
Koboks share the following Species Traits:

- **Ability Modifiers:** All Koboks receive a +2 bonus to their [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution), but suffer -2 penalties to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma). Koboks are deceptively hardy, but are emotionally alien to other [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species).
- **Medium Size:** As Medium creatures, Koboks have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
- **Speed:** Koboks have a base speed of 6 squares.
- **Intellectual Reputation:** A Kobok can use their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) modifier in place of their [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier on [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks.
- **Natural Weapons:** A Kobok has Natural Weapons, in the form of sharp claws. When a Kobok makes an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, it may choose to use its Natural Weapons, dealing 1d6 points of Slashing damage with the attack instead of normal [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) damage. Koboks are always considered armed with their Natural Weapons.
- **Poison:** If the Natural Weapons of a Kobok can deal damage to a living target, the target is also Poisoned. If the Poison succeeds on an attack roll (1d20 + the Kobok's Character Level) against the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), the target moves -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
    - A target moved to the end of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by the Poison is [Immobilized](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Immobilized), but not [Unconscious](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unconscious).
- **Radiation Resistance:** Koboks receive a +5 [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) bonus to their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) against [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation). In addition, Koboks never gain a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) from the effects of [Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation).
