[The Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Light_Side) of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) is not the easiest course to follow, but it's promise of peace and harmony can help even the most weak-willed of Force-users on the right path.

You must have a [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) of 0 to select Talents from this tree; if your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) ever increases to at least 1, you lose access to all Talents in this Talent Tree until your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) drops back to 0.

#### **At Peace**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to gain a +2 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to all [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) until the end of the encounter or until you attack, whichever comes first.

#### **Attuned**
*Prerequisite:* **Focused Attack**

When you roll a Natural 20 on an attack roll against a target with a [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) of 1 or higher, you can activate a single [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Side)*] descriptor immediately as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action).

#### **Focused Attack**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to reroll an attack against a creature with a [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) of 1 or higher, keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Surge of Light**
Once per encounter, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can return any [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Side)*] descriptor to your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) without spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select it, you can use this Talent one additional time per encounter.

#### **Resist Aging**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Jedi Masters (Part 1)*

You can draw upon the living Force to resist the negative effects of [Aging](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aging). This requires a successful [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check and the use of a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) each year, as well as each time the character is reduced to 0 Hit Points or moves -5 steps along the [Condition Track.](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track)

The DC for this [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check is equal to 20 plus an additional 5 for each age range step the character’s true age takes them above their current physical age range. Success means the character remains physically unaged, but gains the bonuses to their [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom), and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) as bestowed by their true age.

Failure means the character physically ages one age range step closer to their true age, incurring any penalties to their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength), [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity), and [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution). Failure by 5 or more means the character ages completely to their true age.
