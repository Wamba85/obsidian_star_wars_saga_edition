*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

You are a member of the Mistryl Shadow Guard, a group of mercenaries from the planet [Emberlene](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emberlene). You excel at [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) and hand-to-hand combat. You hire yourself out to help bring money to your devastated homeworld. You hire yourself out to anyone who wishes your services, though you will not associate yourself with [The Galactic Empire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Galactic_Empire) or its Remnants. 
#### **Everyone Has a Face**

The Guard may make a reroll on [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) checks to wear disguises. She must take the second roll, even if it's worse. The Guard is considered trained in [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) for this check.

You may reroll any [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check to [Deceive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deceive), but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) skill for the purposes of these checks. 

#### **Mistryl Weapon Training**

You are considered proficient in [Hand Claws](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hand_Claws), [Shock Whips](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shock_Whips), and [Zenji Needles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zenji_Needles). You do not need to take necessary [Weapon Proficiency](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency) or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/exotic-weapon-proficiency.md|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]] feats for these weapons.

#### **Mistryl Unarmed Combat**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/martial-arts-i.md|Martial Arts I]]

When fighting [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed), the [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) of your opponents are treated as 5 less against [Stun Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Damage). Additionally, you may treat [Hand Claws](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hand_Claws) as Natural Weapons while [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed).

#### **Out of the Shadows**

Any situation that would give you [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) allows you to make a DC 15 [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check to [Sneak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak). If successful, you may gain the effects of [Flanking](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flanking) against an adjacent opponent, without requiring another character to be positioned.
