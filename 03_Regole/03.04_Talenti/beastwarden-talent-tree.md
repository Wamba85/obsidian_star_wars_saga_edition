*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

You have learned to use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to touch the minds of the [Beasts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beasts), soothing them and convincing them to do your bidding.

#### **Charm Beast **
You can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check in place of a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check when attempting to change the [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of an undomesticated creature with an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) score of 2 or less. Additionally, you do not take the normal -5 penalty on the check if the creature can't speak or understand your language.

This Talent is identical to the [Dathomiri Witch Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charm_Beast) of the same name, and both are considered to be the same Talent for the purposes of satisfying prerequisites.

#### **Bonded Mount**
*Prerequisite:* **Charm Beast**

Whenever you encounter a domesticated [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) with a Friendly or Helpful [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) toward you, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to bond the [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) to you as a mount. A **Bonded Mount** shares an emphatic link with you, allowing you to sense its emotions as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action).

When you [Ride](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ride) a **Bonded Mount**, your mount uses your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) instead of its own. Additionally, if your mount has any special senses (such as Scent, Darkvision, or Low-Light Vision) that you do not possess, you gain the benefits of its special senses as long as you are riding that mount.

#### **Entreat Beast**
*Prerequisite:* **Charm Beast**

You can use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to convince a small [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) to carry objects, deliver messages, or perform other minor tasks for you. If you are near a [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) that is at least Indifferent to you (whether this be a pet you bring with you or a [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) encountered in the wild), you can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check against the Beast's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action).

If your [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) equals or exceeds the Beast's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) performs one task for you from the following list:

- *Deliver an Object:* The [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) attempts, to the best of its ability, to deliver one object from your person to another target within 30 squares of you.
- *Retrieve an Object:* The [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) attempts, to the best of its ability, to retrieve one unattended object within 30 squares of it and its line of sight and bring it to you.
- *Manipulate a Small Object:* The [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) attempts, to the best of its ability, to press a button, pull a lever, or otherwise perform some minor activation of an unattended item within 30 squares.

#### **Soothing Presence **
*Prerequisite:* **Charm Beast**

Whenever you encounter a [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) with an Unfriendly [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) toward you, you automatically shift its [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) to Indifferent (no [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) required).

#### **Wild Sense**
*Prerequisite:* **Charm Beast**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn, you can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to touch the mind of a [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) with an Indifferent or better [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) toward you, provided it is within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight. When you do so, the [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) makes an immediate active [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check, and you are considered to perceive everything the [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) does, including noticing targets, as though you had made the check.

Additionally, until the end of your turn, you are considered to have line of sight to anything the [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) has line of sight to.
