[The Shapers of Kro Var](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shapers_of_Kro_Var) are deeply in touch with the four classic elements of air, earth, fire, and water. They use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to manipulate these elements at a fundamental level, creating impressive effects, such as ripping stone, walls of solid wind, and gouts of flame. The Talents listed here are a small fraction of the "Spells" that these primitive Force-users are capable of using. You must be a member of [The Shapers of Kro Var](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shapers_of_Kro_Var) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Combustion**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-training.md|Force Training]]

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to add 1d6 points of [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage to any [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that causes damage to a single target. A target that takes [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage also catches on [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire).

#### **Earth Buckle**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to create a 3x3 square area of [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) centered on you. You ignore any penalties for moving on [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) that you create using this Talent.

#### **Fluidity**
You can use your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check modifier in place of your [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) check modifier when making [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) checks. If you are entitled to an [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

Additionally, when you attempt a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) or attempt to break free of a [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to be treated as if you were one size category larger.

#### **Thunderclap**
*Prerequisites:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/bantha-rush.md|Bantha Rush]], [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-training.md|Force Training]]

When you use a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that deals damage, you can use the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/bantha-rush.md|Bantha Rush]] feat against that target as though you had made a melee attack.

#### **Wind Vortex**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to surround yourself with whirling winds. You gain [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) from all other targets and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against [Thrown Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown_Weapons). This effect lasts until the end of the encounter.
