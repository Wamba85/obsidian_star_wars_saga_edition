*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

You lead a privileged life and reap the benefit of an upbringing beyond most citizens of the galaxy.

#### **Connections**
You are able to obtain [Licensed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Licensed), [Restricted](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Restricted), [Military](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Military), or [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal) equipment without having to pay a licensing fee or endure a background check, provided the total cost of the desired [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) is equal to or less than your Character Level x 1,000 credits.

In addition, when obtaining [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) or [Services](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Services) through the [Black Market](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Market), you reduce the black market cost multiplier by 1.

#### **Educated**
Thanks to your well-rounded education, you may make any [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) check [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained).

#### **Spontaneous Skill**
*Prerequisite: ***Educated**

Sometimes you surprise others with your skill. Once per day, you may make an [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained) skill check as though you were [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill). Exception: you cannot use this Talent to make an Untrained [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check as though you were [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the skill, unless you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat.

You can select this Talent multiple times; each time you do, you can use it one additional time per day.

#### **Wealth**
Each time you gain a level (including the level at which you select this Talent), you receive an amount of credits equal to 5,000 x your Class Level. You can spend these credits as you see fit.

The credits appear in a civilized, accessible location of your choice or in your private bank account.

You are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) skill.

Once per day, you can have one of these contacts make a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) on your behalf. The contact always [Takes 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Takes_20) on the [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) (even if the [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) would normally not allow [Taking 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Taking_20)) and has a Skill modifier equal to 5 + one-half your Heroic Level.

Contacting your [Influential Contacts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Influential_Contacts) and receiving the benefit of the [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) takes a number of minutes equal to 10 x the [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) result.
