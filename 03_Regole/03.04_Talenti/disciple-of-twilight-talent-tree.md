[The Disciples of Twilight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Disciples_of_Twilight) embody shadow, using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to manipulate light and darkness. You must be a member of [The Disciples of Twilight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Disciples_of_Twilight) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Cloak of Shadows**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to bend light around you, veiling yourself in shadows. Until the end of the encounter, whenever you move and end your movement at least 3 squares away from your starting position, you gain [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) from all targets until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Phantasm**
Whenever you successfully use a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting)*] descriptor against a target, any time before the end of encounter you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to create illusory phantoms around that target.

When you do this, you and all of your allies within the target's line of sight have [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) from the target until the end of your next turn.

#### **Revelation**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of an enemy that has [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) from you or any of your allies. If successful, the enemy is silhouetted by a faint shimmering light that belies their location. Your target loses any [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) bonuses to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the end of your next turn.

#### **Shadow Armor**
*Prerequisite:* **Cloak of Shadows**

You use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to bend light around yourself, wrapping you in shadows and making it difficult for enemies to tell where you end and the shadows begin. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you grant yourself a +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the start of your next turn.

You may select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select it, the [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus it provides increases by +1 (to a maximum of +4).

#### **Shadow Vision**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you gain Low-Light Vision, allowing you to ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (but not [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness. This benefit lasts for 5 minutes or until the end of the encounter, whichever comes first.
