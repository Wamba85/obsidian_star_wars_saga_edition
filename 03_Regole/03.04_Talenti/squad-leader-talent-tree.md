*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

You are a capable military leader who can issue orders to a squad of soldiers with poise and efficiency.
#### **Commanding Officer**
*Y*ou gain a single [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower). Choose either the Aggressive, Defensive, or Utility [Follower Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower_Templates) for your [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower), generating the follower's statistics using the rules found in the [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) page. This [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower) gains one Armor Proficiency Feat of your choice and [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles)), in addition to those provided by the [Follower Templates](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower_Templates). The [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower) must meet the prerequisites for the Armor Proficiency Feat you select.

You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you do, you gain one additional [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower) (maximum of three [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers)).

#### **Coordinated Tactics**
*Prerequisite:* **Commanding Officer**

Each of your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) gains the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/coordinated-attack.md|Coordinated Attack]] Feat, provided he or she meets the prerequisite. If your [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower) later meets the prerequisite for the Feat, they gain the Feat at that time.

#### **Fire at Will**
*Prerequisites:* **Commanding Officer**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you and one of your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) can make a ranged attack against one target (each) in line of sight. You each take a -5 penalty to your attack rolls.

#### **Squad Actions**
*Prerequisite:* **Commanding Officer**

You and your squad have learned to work together as a team, and have an established set of tactics that you have practiced to perfection. You can use any of the following Actions on your turn.
- *Autofire Barrage:* As a Standard Action, you can make an [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) attack against legal target spaces. For each of your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) who is armed with a ranged Weapon set on [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) and has a line of sight to the area targeted by your [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire), you can designate one additional square as targeted by your [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) (that square must be adjacent to your original target area).
- *Open Fire:* As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a ranged attack against a single target. For each of your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) who is armed with a ranged Weapon and has a line of sight to the target, add +2 to your damage roll on a successful hit.
- *Painted Target:* As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a ranged attack against a single target. You gain a competence bonus on your attack roll equal to the number of your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) who are armed with a ranged Weapon and have line of sight to the target. Thus, if you have three armed [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) with line of sight to the target, you gain a +3 competence bonus on your attack roll.
