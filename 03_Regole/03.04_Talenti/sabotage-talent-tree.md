*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

You are skilled at improvising Weapons, handling [Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Explosives), and disrupting the enemy.

#### **Device Jammer **
You can construct a short-range Jammer that affects a specific type of electronic device such as a personal [Energy Shields](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Shields), [Comlink](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Comlink), [Portable Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Portable_Computer), or [Datapad](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Datapad). As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you select a particular piece of personal, portable electronic [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) (any item listed as equipment excluding [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) and [Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons), that has an electronic component) and make a DC 20 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to build the Jammer.

If the check is successful, all devices of the chosen type cease to function while within 12 squares of your position for the remainder of the encounter. You may only have one Jammer (Device or [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid)) active at a time.

#### **Droid Jammer **
You can construct a short-range Jammer that affects [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids). As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you make a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to build the Jammer. When a [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) comes within 6 squares of you, compare the result of your [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to the Droid's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If your check result equals or exceeds the Droid's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the Droid can only take [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) as long as it remains within the radius of the Jammer.

Droids that are immune to the effect of a [Restraining Bolt](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Restraining_Bolt) are immune to the effects of this Talent. The Jammer functions for the remainder of the encounter. You may only have one Jammer (Device or [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid)) active at a time.

#### **Extreme Explosion**
*Prerequisites:* **Skilled Demolitionist**, **Shaped Explosion**

You know how to set large charges and use dozens of charges for extremely large explosives. You increase the [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst) radius of any [Mines](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mines) or [Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Explosives) by 1 square.

#### **Mine Mastery**
You can place a [Mine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mine) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) instead of a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

#### **Shaped Explosion**
*Prerequisite:* **Skilled Demolitionist**

You know how to set charges to direct a blast in a specific direction or manner. You can shape an explosion caused by [Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Explosives) or [Mines](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mines) that you set into a line or a cone instead of a radius. The length of the line is equal to 2 x the radius of the explosive [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst); the length of the cone is equal to 3 x the radius of the [Burst](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Burst), and either the line or the cone originates from the square where the [Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Explosives) are placed.

#### **Skilled Demolitionist**
You can set a [Detonator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Detonator) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), and your [Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Explosives) never go off as the [Detonator](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Detonator) is being placed, even if you fail the check by 10 or more. You must still roll to determine if the charge otherwise goes off as planned (see [Handle Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Handle_Explosives)).
## Homebrew Sabotage Talents

#### **Expect the Unexpected**
*Expect the Unexpected Talent created by Wikia user Admire Lucas.*

The range for Unexpected Results increases by 1; that is, it triggers on an attack from an eligible weapon against you on a Natural 1 or 2.
#### **Malicious Glitches**
*Malicious Glitches Talent created by Wikia user Admire Lucas.*

*Prerequisite:* Any two Talents from the Sabotage Talent Tree

Whenever Unexpected Results would trigger, the wielder must choose to either take half the damage that would have been dealt against you, or roll 2d20 for a result on the Glitch table, below. 
{| class="wikitable"

!ROLL (2D20)

|-
|2
|Unfortunate Victim
|As the original Unexpected Results, and until the end of the encounter, Unexpected Results may trigger by any eligible roll from the wielder with any other eligible weapon they have.
|-
|3-10
|Puff of Smoke
|As the original Unexpected Results; on a roll of a 3, the range of Unexpected Results is extended upward by 1 until the end of your next turn, and on a roll of a 4, until the end of the encounter.
|-
|11-20
|False Alarm
|The weapon continues to work, and immediately hits you.
|-
|21-25
|Firewall
|As the original Unexpected Results, and the closest droid in line of sight, if any, gets a Standard Action that must be used immediately and in a hostile manner towards the wielder, or else it is lost.
|-
|26-35
|Face Full of Smoke
|The weapon is destroyed as it explodes in a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-square Burst on rolls of 26-29, 30-32, 33-34, or 35 respectively, making an attack with the wielder's Base Attack Bonus + 5 against the Fortitude Defense of everything in range, dealing half the weaponâ€™s damage as Energy damage to every creature and Ion damage to every object affected.
|-
|36
|Sticky Trap
|As the original Unexpected Results, and the weapon cannot be dropped or exchanged with another weapon until a successful DC 15 Strength check is made as a Standard Action; someone other than the wielder may make this check with Favorable Circumstances, but if they roll a Natural 1, they will become trapped as well, they become Encumbered, their initiative drops to after the wielder's, and they must move along with the wielder.
|-
|37-38
|Traumatic Demoralization
|As the original Unexpected Results, but a special attack roll using your Base Attack Bonus and Intelligence modifier is made against the wielder's Will Defense; if successful, the victim takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls or skill checks (your choice) until the end of their next turn on a 37 or end of the encounter on a 38. This is a Mind-Affecting effect.
|-
|39
|Kickback
|The weapon continues to work normally, but the wielder is forced to re-roll and make an attack against the nearest ally in line of sight; if there is no eligible target, the attack goes nowhere.
|-
|40
|Unfortunate Victims
|As Unfortunate Victim, but for both the wielder and every ally of the wielder in the wielder's line of sight.
