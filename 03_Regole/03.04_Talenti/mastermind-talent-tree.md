*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

You have the ability to attract loyal Minions, and are skilled at redirecting allies on the battlefield.

#### **Attract Minion**
You attract a loyal Minion. The Minion is a [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) character with a Class Level equal to three-quarters of your Character Level, rounded down.

You may select this Talent multiple times; each time you select this Talent, you gain another Minion. Normally, you can have only one Minion with you at a time. Any other Minions you have are assumed to be looking after your various interests. If you lose a Minion, you can send for another Minion if you have one (although normal [Travel Time](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Travel_Time) still applies).

Each Minion that accompanies you on an adventure is entitled to an equal share of the total [Experience Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_Points) earned for that adventure.  For example, a Minion that accompanies a party of five heroes on an adventure receives one-sixth of the XP that the group earns.

#### **Impel Ally I**
You can spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to grant one ally the ability to move its normal speed. The ally must move immediately on your turn, before you do anything else, or else the opportunity is wasted. You can use this Talent up to three times on your turn (spending a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) each time).

#### **Impel Ally II**
*Prerequisite: ***Impel Ally I**

You can spend two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to grant one ally the ability to take a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) or [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action). The ally must move immediately on your turn, before you do anything else, or else the opportunity is wasted.
