*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

[Kel Dor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Kel_Dor) who become Baran Do Sages are contemplative and insightful, using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to unravel the skeins of the past, present, and future to determine the best course of action. They are masters of *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* and other Sense-related Force abilities, making them excellent as both investigators and advisors. You must be a member of [The Baran Do Sages](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Baran_Do_Sages) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Enhanced Danger Sense**
You gain a +10 bonus on [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks made to avoid being [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised). Additionally, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to act in the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round), even if you are [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised).

#### **Expanded Horizon**
Whenever you use the [Search Your Feelings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Search_Your_Feelings) application of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill, you can sense the consequences of your actions out to 1 hour into the future (instead of the normal 10 minutes). You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) when you do so to expand this window out to 8 hours, or a [Destiny Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Point) to expand this window out to 24 hours.

#### **Knowledge and Defense**
*Prerequisite:* **Enhanced Danger Sense**

You add your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) whenever your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus would normally be denied to you.

#### **Planetary Attunement**
Whenever you arrive on a new planet, you can spend 10 minutes and a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to acclimate yourself to the planet's unique ebb and flow of [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) energy.

While on the planet, you gain a +2 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to all [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) against naturally occurring [Hazards](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazards) on the world, your Speed increases by 1 square, and you can sense what the weather will be like to the immediate area up to 24 hours in advance as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

#### **Precognitive Meditation**
Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes meditating to seek visions of the future. At that time, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a part of this meditation.

Once during the rest of the day, whenever you or a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) you [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) are the target of an attack, you can choose to negate that attack provided the attack roll is not a Natural 20. At the end of the day, if you did not use this ability, you regain the [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) spent on the meditation.
