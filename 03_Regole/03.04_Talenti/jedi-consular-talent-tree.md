*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

[Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) that follow the path of the consular are skilled ambassadors. You prefer to use the strength of your words and the wisdom that the Force provides to solve problems. 

#### **Adept Negotiator**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can weaken the resolve of one opponent with your words. The target must have an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) of 3 or higher, and it must be able to see, hear, and understand you. Make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check; if the result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), it moves -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). The target gets a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) if it is higher level than you.

If the target reaches the end of its [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), it does not fall unconscious, instead, it cannot attack you or your allies for the remainder of the encounter unless you or one of your allies attacks it or one of its allies first. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

You affect the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) of the specific character (usually the Vehicle's [Commander](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander)), not a Starship.

#### **Force Persuasion**
*Prerequisite:* **Adept Negotiator**

You can use your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) modifier instead of your [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check modifier when making a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill. If you are entitled to a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Master Negotiator**
*Prerequisite:* **Adept Negotiator**

If you successfully use the **Adept Negotiator** Talent, your target moves an additional -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect. You affect the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) of the specific character (usually the Vehicle's [Commander](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander)), not a Starship.

#### **Skilled Advisor**
You can spend a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) advising an ally, thereby granting them a +5 bonus on their next [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check). If you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point), the bonus increases to +10. The target must be able to (and willing) to hear and understand your voice. You cannot advise yourself. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

## Additional Jedi Consular Talents

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can peer into [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) and search for weaknesses in the defenses of your enemies.

If the [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that target takes a -2 penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against you and all allies who can hear and understand you until the end of your next turn.

These [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) last until the beginning of your next turn (at which point any remaining [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) are lost), and any damage dealt to that ally comes out of [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) first.

#### **Guiding Strikes**

If you do so, allies adjacent to the target at the time you make the attack gain a +2 circumstance bonus to melee attack rolls against the target until the start of your next turn.

#### **Renew Vision**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

If your check result equals or exceeds the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of the target of that missed attack, the attacker can reroll the missed attack roll.

This counts as using the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power against the target, but this Talent replaces the normal rules and effects of *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*. Any attack can only be affected by this Talent once (thus, multiple characters cannot use this Talent on the same attack to allow multiple rerolls).

You take a cumulative -5 penalty on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks until the beginning of your next turn when you use this Talent.

#### **Visionary Defense**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check after you or an ally within 12 squares is the target of a melee or ranged attack (but before the results of the attack roll are known), removing one use of the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power from your active [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) (as though you had activated the [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power)).

If your check result equals or exceeds the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of the attacker, you grant the target of that attack a +5 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against that attack.

This counts as using the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power against the attacker, but this Talent replaces the normal rules and effects of *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*. Any attack can only be affected by this Talent once (thus, multiple characters cannot use this Talent on the same attack to allow multiple rerolls).

You take a cumulative -5 penalty on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks until the beginning of your next turn when you use this Talent.

#### **WatchCircle Initiate**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

If successful, you subtract 1 from your [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) total (this cannot be subtracted from temporary [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points), and does not count as spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point)), and add 1 to the [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) total of an ally within line of sight.

This counts as using the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power against the target, but this Talent replaces the normal rules and effects of *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*.
