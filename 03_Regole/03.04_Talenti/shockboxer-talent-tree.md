*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

You are trained in the [Shockboxing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shockboxing) fighting style and can use your fists to devastate your enemies. Although you trained for competitive [Shockboxing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shockboxing), much of your expertise can also be applied outside the ring.

#### **Defensive Jab**
*Prerequisite:* **Retaliation Jab**

When you are [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) and take the [Fight Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fight_Defensively) Action, you can make a single [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) against an adjacent target.

#### **Nimble Dodge**
If an enemy misses you with a melee attack, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can move up to 2 squares, but you must end your movement adjacent to your attacker.

#### **Retaliation Jab**
If an enemy misses you with a melee attack, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can automatically deal damage equal to your [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier (minimum 1 point of damage) to your attacker, if the attacker is within your Reach.

#### **Stinging Jab**
When you hit a target with an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, you can choose to deal half damage with your attack. If you do so, your enemy also deals half damage on all melee attacks he or she makes until the end of your next turn.

#### **Stunning Shockboxer**
*Prerequisite:* **Stinging Jab**

When you deal [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage to a target with an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, after the [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) is halved, roll one extra die of damage and add that to the damage subtracted from the target's Hit Points.
