*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You know how to find just what you need, no matter how far you are from civilization or how rare the item is. If you can't find it, you make it- but most of the time you find it.

#### **Black Market Buyer**
When seeking an item from the [Black Market](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Market), you do not need to make a [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check to locate a Black Market merchant; you automatically succeed.
#### **Excellent Kit**
You always make sure that your allies have the best gear available. Whenever you purchase Weapons, Armor, or other [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) (either legally or through the Black Market), all gear you purchase has 50% more Hit Points than normal and has 5 more DR than normal.

In addition, whenever one of your allies makes a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check on an object that you purchased, that ally gains a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to the check.
#### **Just What is Needed**
You have a knack for finding the best quality replacement parts for broken [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment). Whenever you use the [Repair](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair) application of the [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) skill, you restore an extra 1d8 Hit Points with a successful [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check, in addition to what you would normally restore.

If you use the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action to assist an ally with [Repairs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repairs), that ally also [Repairs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repairs) an extra 1d8 Hit Points with a successful [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check. Any ally can only benefit from this Talent once per [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check, regardless of how many allies with this Talent aid on the check.
#### **Only the Finest**
*Prerequisite:* **Black Market Buyer**

Whenever you purchase goods through the [Black Market](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Market), you can obtain items that have been modified with the [Tech Specialist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_Specialist) feat without increasing the base value of the items.
#### **Right Gear for the Job**
Once per day when an ally makes an [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained) skill check, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can grant that ally a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to the check, and the ally is considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in that [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) for the purpose of using [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained)-only applications of the [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill).

You cannot use this Talent to allow an ally to make an Untrained [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check.
