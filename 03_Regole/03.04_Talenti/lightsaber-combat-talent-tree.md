*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

The [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) is the chosen weapon of [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi). Not as clumsy or random as a blaster, the [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) is an elegant weapon for a more civilized combatant. The following talents allow you to improve your prowess with a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber).

#### **Block**
*See also: [Saber Lock](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saber_Lock)*

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you may negate a melee attack by making a successful [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check. The DC of the check is equal to the result of the attack roll you wish to negate, and you must take a cumulative -5 penalty on your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check for every time you have used **Block** or **Deflect** since the beginning of your last turn.

You may use the **Block** Talent to negate melee [Area Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks), such as those made by the [Whirlwind Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Whirlwind_Attack) Feat. If you succeed on the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, you take half damage if the attack hits, and no damage if the attack misses. You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to use this Talent to negate an attack against an adjacent character.

You must have a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) drawn and ignited to use this Talent, and you must be aware of the attack and not [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed).

#### **Deflect**
As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you may negate a ranged attack by making a successful [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check. The DC of the check is equal to the result of the attack roll you wish to negate, and you take a cumulative -5 penalty on your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check for every time you used **Block** or **Deflect** since the beginning of your last turn. You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to use this Talent to negate an attack against an adjacent character. 

You can use this Talent to deflect some of the barrage of shots fired from a ranged weapon set on [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire), or the *[Force Lightning](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Lightning)* Force Power. If you succeed on the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, you take half damage if the attack hits, and no damage if the attack misses.

You must have a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) drawn and ignited to use this Talent, and you must be aware of the attack and not [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed).

This Talent cannot be used to negate attacks made by Colossal (Frigate) or larger-size [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) unless the attack is made with a [Point-Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Point-Defense) Weapon System.

#### **Lightsaber Defense**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) you can use your [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) to parry your opponents' attacks, gaining a +1 deflection bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the start of your next turn. You must have a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) drawn and ignited to use this Talent, and you don't gain the deflection bonus if you are [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) or otherwise unaware of the incoming attack.

You can take this Talent multiple times; each time you take this Talent, the deflection bonus increases by +1 (maximum +3).

#### **Weapon Specialization (Lightsabers)**
*Prerequisite:* [Weapon Focus (Lightsabers)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Lightsabers))

You gain a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls with [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers).

#### **Lightsaber Throw**
You can throw a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), treating it as a [Thrown](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown) weapon (without this Talent, a thrown [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) is considered an [Improvised Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Improvised_Thrown_Weapon)). You are considered proficient with the thrown [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), and you apply the normal [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) penalties to the attack roll. The thrown [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) deals normal weapon damage if it hits.

If your target is no more than 6 squares away, you can pull your [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) back to your hand as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) by making a DC 20 [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check.

#### **Redirect Shot**
*Prerequisites:* **Deflect**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

This Talent allows you to redirect a deflected blaster bolt along a specific trajectory, so that it damages another creature or object in its path. Once per round when you successfully **Deflect** a blaster bolt, you can make an immediate ranged attack against another target with which you have line of sight.

Apply the normal range penalties to the attack roll, not counting the distance the bolt traveled to reach you. If the attack succeeds, it deals normal weapon damage to the target. Only single blaster bolts can be redirected in this manner. Barrages from [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) weapons and other types of projectiles can't be redirected.
