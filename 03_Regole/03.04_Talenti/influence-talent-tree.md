*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

One of your greatest strengths is your ability to exert influence over your opponents.

#### **Presence**
You can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) a creature as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) (instead of a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action)).

#### **Demand Surrender**
*Prerequisite:* **Presence**

Once per encounter, you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to demand surrender from an opponent who has been reduced to one-half or less of its hit points. If your check result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), it surrenders to you and your allies, drops any weapons it is holding, and takes no hostile actions. If the target is higher level than you, it gains a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If you or any of your allies attack it, it no longer submits to your will and can act normally. You can only use this Talent against a particular target once per encounter. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

Unlike other [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effects, you need only to hail a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) to **Demand Surrender**. You can demand surrender of a vehicle that has been reduced to one-half or fewer of its hit points, even if the crew is uninjured. You make your check against the Vehicle's [Commander](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander); all [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) crews are assumed to have a [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of 10. If the CL of the target [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) is greater than your Heroic Level or the CL of your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), the target gains a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). You can't use this Talent to **Demand Surrender** from a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) that is more than one size larger than yours under any circumstances- [Star Destroyers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_I-Class_Star_Destroyer) don't surrender to [X-Wings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/T-65B_X-Wing_Starfighter).

#### **Improved Weaken Resolve**
*Prerequisites:* **Presence**,** Weaken Resolve**

As **Weaken Resolve**, except that the target doesn't stop fleeing from you if it is wounded.

#### **Weaken Resolve**
*Prerequisite:* **Presence**

Once per round, when you deal damage equal to or greater than the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action); if the result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), you fill the target with terror, causing it to flee from you at top speed for 1 minute. The target can't take [Standard Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Actions), [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions), or [Full-Round Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Actions) while fleeing, but the target stops fleeing and can act normally if it is wounded. As a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) or [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), the target can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) (if it has not already spent one earlier in the round) to negate the effect. The effect is automatically negated if the target's level is equal to or higher than your Character Level. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) fear effect.

Unlike with other [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effects, you need only to hail a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) to weaken the crew's resolve. When you deal damage that equals or exceeds a Vehicle's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), you may use this Talent; in addition, you may [Ready](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ready) an Action to use this Talent after any [Gunner](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunner) on your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) deals damage that equals or exceeds a Vehicle's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). You make your check against the Vehicle's [Commander](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander); all [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) crews are assumed to have a [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of 10. The effect is automatically negated if the target Vehicle's Challenge Level is greater than your Heroic Level or your Vehicle's Challenge Level.
