[Midi-chlorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Midi-chlorians) are symbiotic beings that help bind the universe together through [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). You have learned to listen to your [Midi-chlorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Midi-chlorians) to further enhance your use of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).

#### **Voices**
The [Midi-chlorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Midi-chlorians) are speaking to you. They're whispering, calling on you to do things, you know, *just* for them. Once per encounter, roll 1d20+5 + 1/2 your Heroic Level versus your [Force Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force Defense). If it exceeds your score, the gamemaster will hand you a note, with the Midi-chlorians' "request". It might come in the form of a brief vision, a particular feeling or impulse.

You suffer a -5 penalty to any attack or other check until you carry out the Midi-chlorians' "request." You gain a +10 to one skill check made during the encounter in carrying out the request. If you succeed, you are granted one temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) that must be used before the end of the encounter.

#### **Midi-chlorian Challenge**
*Prerequisite:* **Voices**

You have learned to challenge your [Midi-chlorians](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Midi-chlorians). If you succeed, you force them to obey your commands for a change. If you fail, your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) modifier suffers. Once per encounter, as a swift action, roll 1d20 + your Character Level against your own [Force Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Defense). Apply the result as a modifier to your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks.

#### **Midi-chlorian Control**
*Prerequisites:* **Voices***,* **Midi-chlorian Challenge**

Control! Control! You're finally learning Control! As a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), you may add +5 to your [Force Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Defense) or your own rolls versus your own [Force Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Defense) during the encounter.

#### **Stop Messing With Me!**
*Prerequisites:* **Voices**, **Midi-chlorian Challenge**, **Midi-chlorian Control**

You're learning to follow your own path. You may reroll any Midi-chlorian check and may take the better result.

#### **Midi-chlorian Mastery**
*Prerequisites:* **Voices***,* **Midi-chlorian Challenge**, **Midi-chlorian Control**

Now YOU are the Master. If you receive a Midi-chlorian request, you may ignore it and still receive the temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point).
