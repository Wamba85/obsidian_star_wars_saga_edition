*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

You never travel anywhere without a blaster (or two), and you know how to handle yourself in a gunfight. 

The following Talents may only be used with [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols) or [Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifles). 

#### **Debilitating Shot**
If you [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) before making a ranged attack, you move the target character -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) if the attack deals damage. This Talent can be used only against characters, not objects or [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles).

#### **Deceptive Shot**
Select one target in line of sight within 6 squares. You can spend two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) on the same turn to make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check; if the check result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the target is denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against your attacks until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Improved Quick Draw**
If you are carrying a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) (either in your hand or in a holster), you may draw the [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) and make a single attack during a [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round), even if you are [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised).

If you are not [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised), you may take any single [Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Action) of your choice, as normal.

#### **Knockdown Shot**
If you [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) before making a ranged attack, and the attack hits, you knock the target [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) in addition to dealing damage. You can't use this Talent to knock down targets two or more size categories bigger than you.

#### **Multiattack Proficiency (Pistols)**
Whenever you make multiple attacks with any type of [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) as part of a [Full Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full_Attack), you reduce the penalty on your attack rolls by 2.

You can take this Talent multiple times; each time you take this Talent, you reduce the penalty on your attack rolls by an additional 2.

#### **Ranged Disarm**
You can [Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm) an opponent using a ranged attack. If your ranged [Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm) attack fails, your opponent doesn't get to make a free attack against you.

#### **Trigger Work**
You take no penalty on your attack roll when using the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] feat.

## Additional Gunslinger Talents

#### **Blind Shot**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

You ignore the penalties on your ranged attack rolls when a target has [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) or [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment).

#### **Damaging Disarm**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue)*

*Prerequisite:* **Ranged Disarm**

If you successfully [Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm) an opponent using a ranged attack, the target also takes half damage from the attack.

#### **Keep Them Honest**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/careful-shot.md|Careful Shot]]

When using the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action to [Suppress an Enemy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Suppress_an_Enemy), the enemy instead takes a -5 penalty to all attack rolls until the end of your next turn.

#### **Lingering Debilitation**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

*Prerequisite:* **Debilitating Shot**

Once per encounter, when you successfully use **Debilitating Shot** to move a target character -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), the target suffers a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) requiring 4 hours of rest or a DC 25 [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check to remove. 

#### **Mobile Attack (Pistols)**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

Immediately after making a [Full Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full_Attack) where you attack with two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols), you may move up to your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action).

#### **Pistol Duelist**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue)*

You are a master of the elegant, if archaic, custom of dueling with [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols). You can use each of the following Actions once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action):
- *End Game:* You make a single ranged attack with a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) against an opponent within [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). The opponent's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) is halved (rounded down) for the purpose of this attack.
- *Snap Aiming:* You make a single ranged attack with the benefits of [Aiming](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aiming).
- *Stand Ready:* You gain a +4 bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the end of your next turn and make a single ranged attack.

#### **Ranged Flank**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

If you are within 6 squares of a target and are armed with a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) or a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle), you can act as though you occupied the nearest square adjacent to the target for purposes of determining whether or not you or any allies are [Flanking](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flanking) that target.

You may only be considered to be [Flanking](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flanking) a single target at a time. You must spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) on your turn to designate the target you [Flank](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flank) at range.

#### **Retreating Fire**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

When moving away from a pursuing target, if you either [Run](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Run) or use two [Move](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move) Actions during this turn, you can make a single ranged attack with a -5 penalty as part of your [Move](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move) Action. 

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to avoid the penalty. 

#### **Slowing Shot**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

*Prerequisite:* **Debilitating Shot**

If you successfully use **Debilitating Shot**, until the target moves to the normal state on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) or until the end of the encounter, the target's [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) is reduced by 2 squares, and it loses its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed). 

These effects occur in addition to the effect of **Debilitating Shot**. If you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point), the target's [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed) is reduced by 4 squares or half of its normal speed, whichever is the greater reduction. 

#### **Swift Shot**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

Once per encounter, you can make a single ranged attack with a handheld weapon as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) instead of a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action). However, you cannot use your remaining [Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Actions) for an attack. 
## Homebrew Gunslinger Talents

#### **Extended Critical Range (Pistols)**
*Extended Critical Range (Pistols) Talent created by Wikia user LilLiteralist.*

*Prerequisites:* [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +10, [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols))

When you are using a [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol), you extend the weapon's critical range by 1 (for example, 19-20 instead of 20). However, anything other than a Natural 20 is not considered an automatic hit; if you roll anything other than a Natural 20 and still miss the target, you do not score a Critical Hit.
