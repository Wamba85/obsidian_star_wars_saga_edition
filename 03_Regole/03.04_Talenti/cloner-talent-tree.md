*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Grand Army of the Republic (Part 1)*

You are trained in the science of cloning and gene manipulation, allowing you to create copies of individuals or animals, and modify them to suit your needs.

#### **Clone Scientist**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences))

Your knowledge of genetic manipulation and cloning allows you to create desired mutations or other alterations. Specific traits are given on the table below. You may add as many traits as you like, though each trait can only be added once unless otherwise noted.

All traits must be selected at clone gestation, and clones must be grown from embryos, using the appropriate Species [Age](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age) table to reach maturity unless otherwise noted.

This Trait may be taken multiple times, but never with the same Natural Weapon.

Before beginning cloning, you must acquire a DNA sample of living tissue from a donor, and pay 50,000 credits per Heroic Level, or 10,000 credits per [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) Level of the creature or being to be cloned in order to cover genetic research and development. This is for pure genetic replication.

Creating the clone requires a DC 25 [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)) check; you can't [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) or [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on this check, the time to grow the clone is determined by the [Cloning Tank](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cloning_Tank). The condition of the DNA, as well as the Equipment used for cloning, may make the process more difficult:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Sub-Standard Equipment
|
|<nowiki>+5</nowiki>
|-
|State-of-the-Art Equipment
|
|<nowiki>-5</nowiki>
|}

If the check succeeds, you create a level 1 ([Heroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic) or [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic)) [Child](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Child)-aged clone with the same [Abilities](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities), gender, and [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) as the donor (modified for the [Child](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Child) template, minus bonuses from [Cybernetics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cybernetics), [Destiny](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny), or levels gained). If the check fails, the clone is defective, although its organic matter can still be salvaged. If the check fails by 5 or more, you lose all credits spent creating the clone, though you may start over with a fresh DNA sample if you wish.

Other characters [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)) can assist you, reducing proportionately the time needed to complete the cloning process. They can make a [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)) check to [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) on your check.

#### **Gene Splicing**
*Prerequisites:* **Clone Scientist**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences))

You have unlocked the secrets of combining the genes of a variety of creatures to create mutations and even new [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species). When you create a gene-spliced clone, first select a DNA template as normal. Next, you may add additional template [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species), each time adding either one method of movement, one natural weapon, or one Species Trait or special quality.

Every additional [Species](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Species) spliced adds +10 to the cloning attempt DC. Each new form of movement adds +10 to the DC, each new natural weapon/attack adds +5 to the DC, and each Species Trait or special quality adds +10 to the DC. Spliced Traits can stack with **Clone Scientist** and **Master Cloner** traits.

#### **Mass Cloning**
*Prerequisites:* **Clone Scientist**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences))

You specialize in creating large groups of clones from a single source at one time. The table below determines the increase to the DC modifier. Note, you must have a number of [Cloning Tanks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cloning_Tanks) equal to the number of clones you wish to simultaneously create prior to attempting a **Mass Cloning**.

When cloning, you may select advanced traits for the clone, listed below. These traits may be selected in tandem with the Clone Scientist Traits, unless stated otherwise.

This Trait can only be taken once.

#### **Rapid Cloning**
*Prerequisites:* **Clone Scientist**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences))

You have found ways to increase the rate of aging of clones to more quickly put them in service. The overall cost of the creation of the clone is increased by the age modifier. When a clone whose age has been accelerated moves at least -2 steps down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) in the same encounter, they also add a year to their relative [Age](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Age). Also note that while accelerated [Aging](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aging) brings the clones to physical maturity more quickly, mentally, they progress at their actual physical age.

This means that a [Human](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Human) clone who is engineered to age twice as fast as normal, will be a physical adult after eight years ([Humans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Humans) are [Adults](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Adults) at 16-40 years old), giving them no modifiers of a [Child](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Child) to [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence), [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) and [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) until they are twelve years old (twenty-four in clone years).

#### **Retrovirus**
*Prerequisites:* **Clone Scientist**, **Master Cloner**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences))

Your mastery of genetic manipulation has extended to affecting those already alive and modifying how their genes are expressed. You can create a **Retrovirus** that allows a single Clone Scientist Trait to be expressed in a living being. Creation of the **Retrovirus** will only work for one individual and clones of that individual, and still requires all the costs and [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) as if creating a clone of that person, with the addition of +20 increase to the Cloning DC.

Further, each time a **Retrovirus** is used, the subject risks corrupting their DNA, and must resist an attack on their [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) with an attack bonus of +5. A successful hit moves the target a [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) for cellular destabilization. At -5 steps, their DNA is hopelessly corrupted, and their cells break down, causing [Death](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Death).
