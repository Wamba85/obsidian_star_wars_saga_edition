*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You make it difficult for enemies to harm you because you're never in the place where they expect you to be. When they do manage to hurt you, you make them pay for it with sudden retribution attacks.

#### **Aggressive Surge**
Once per encounter when you catch a [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind), you can make a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), provided that you can make a charge attack against a legal target at the time you catch a [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind).

#### **Blast Back**
Once per round when you are damaged by an enemy's [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack), as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can make an immediate melee or ranged attack against the source of the [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack), provided that you have line of sight to the attacker and the target is within your melee or ranged reach.

#### **Fade Away**
Once per turn when you are damaged by an enemy's attack, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).

#### **Second Strike**
*Prerequisite:* **Blast Back**

Once per encounter when you miss a target with a single melee or ranged attack, as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) you can move up to half your speed and make a second attack of the same type against a different target. This movement doesn't provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
	
If you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/combat-reflexes.md|Combat Reflexes]] feat, you may use this Talent a number of times per encounter equal to your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus (minimum 1). You may still only use this Talent once per round.

#### **Swerve**
*Prerequisite:* **Fade Away**

Once per encounter when an enemy makes an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) against you, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can automatically negate the attack and immediately move up to half your speed. This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
	
If you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/combat-reflexes.md|Combat Reflexes]] feat, you may use this Talent a number of times per encounter equal to your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus (minimum 1). You may still only use this Talent once per round.
