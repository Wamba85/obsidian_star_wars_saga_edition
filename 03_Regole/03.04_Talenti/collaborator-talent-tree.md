<nowiki> </nowiki>Some [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobles) learn to work both sides of the conflict in war and can manipulate their enemies into believing they are allies. 

#### **Double Agent**
When you roll [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) at the beginning of combat, also roll a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check, comparing the result to the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of all enemies in line of sight. If your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check is successful, that target cannot attack you and does not believe you to be an enemy (though they do not consider you an ally) while this effect is active.

If you attack or otherwise obviously harm or hinder a target under the effect of this Talent, or one of that target's allies, this effect ends. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Enemy Tactics**
Whenever an enemy within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight receives an insight or morale bonus from any source, you can also gain that bonus, subject to all the same limitations as the bonus provided to that enemy.

#### **Feed Information**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can grant one enemy a +1 bonus on its next attack roll made before the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, until the beginning of your next turn, you can designate one ally who receives a +2 bonus on its next attack roll.

#### **Friendly Fire**
*Prerequisite*: **Enemy Tactics**

If you are engaged in melee combat with an adjacent enemy and are the target of a ranged attack that misses you, compare the attack roll to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of one adjacent enemy; if the attack equals or exceeds the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), that enemy becomes the new target of the attack, which is resolved as normal.

#### **Protection**
*Prerequisite*: **Double Agent**

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can designate one ally and make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check, comparing the result against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of all enemies in your line of sight who can hear and understand you. If your check result equals or exceeds a target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that target cannot attack the ally you designated until the beginning of your next turn.

Characters that use this Talent or the [**Draw Fire**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Draw_Fire) Talent cannot be targeted by or benefit from this Talent. You may not benefit from this Talent at the same time as the [**Misplaced Loyalty**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Misplaced_Loyalty) Talent.
