You are known for your ability to adapt to any situation, heedless of adversity.

#### **Adapt and Survive**
When an enemy within 24 squares of you and in your line of sight receives a morale or insight bonus of any kind, you also gain the benefits of that bonus until the end of your next turn.

#### **Defensive Protection**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) and add the results of the [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to any one of your [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses), or to one of the [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) of an adjacent ally. This bonus lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Quick on Your Feet**
Once per encounter, you may move up to your Speed as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

#### **Ready and Willing**
When you [Ready](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ready) an Action, you can choose at any time before the start of your next turn to take your [Readied Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Readied_Action) at the end of the current turn, after the acting creature, [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), or [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) completes its Action.

#### **Unbalancing Adaptation**
*Prerequisite:* **Adapt and Survive**

When you use the **Adapt and Survive** Talent, you also deny the target the bonus that triggered the Talent to one enemy within your line of sight.
