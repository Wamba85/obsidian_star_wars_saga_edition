*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

You have dedicated yourself to the art of creation, learning how to craft Weapons and other items used by the Jedi with exquisite detail.

#### **Call Weapon**
You can use the [Move Light Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Light_Object) application of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) Skill to call a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) you built into your hand and ignite it as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). The Weapon must be in your line of sight to call it to your hand.

#### **Lightsaber Specialist**
*Prerequisite:* **Masterwork Lightsaber**

Whenever you are armed with a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) that you built, you gain a +2 morale bonus on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks made to use the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** and **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)** Talents.

#### **Masterwork Lightsaber**
Whenever you build a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) (see [Advanced Lightsaber Construction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Lightsaber_Construction)), you do so with such expertise that it makes the Weapon even more refined and elegant. When you build a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), you can choose to add one extra Lightsaber Accessory or Modification at the time of creation.

And, when you hit a target with a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) that you built, you can always choose to reroll one damage die from your damage roll, but you must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

In addition, you can mentor another character while they construct their own [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber). When you do so, you reduce the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check DC for [Advanced Lightsaber Construction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Lightsaber_Construction) by -5.

#### **Perfect Attunement**
*Prerequisite:* **Masterwork Lightsaber**

Whenever you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to add to a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) attack roll made with a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) you built, you can add that same amount to the damage roll if the attack hits.

#### **Quick Modification**
*Prerequisite:* **Masterwork Lightsaber**

You can spend 1 minute modifying a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) you have built, removing one [Lightsaber Accessory](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Accessory) or [Lightsaber Modification](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Modification) and putting a different one its place.

Gamemasters may rule that some modifications cannot be added or removed in this way due to rarity of materials or the difficulty of the [Lightsaber Modification](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_Modification) (such as adding or removing the [Electrum Detail](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Electrum_Detail)).
