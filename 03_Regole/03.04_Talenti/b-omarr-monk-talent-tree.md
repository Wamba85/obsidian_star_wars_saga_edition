*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Edition All-Purpose Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Edition_All-Purpose_Sourcebook)*

By cutting themselves off from all civilization and distraction, B'omarr Monks are capable of achieving a certain sense of "Enlightenment." You must be a member of [The B'omarr Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_B'omarr_Order) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Cyborg Avatar**
*Prerequisite:* **Droid Receptacle**, **Shedding of the Body**

When catching a [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind), you may add your Hit Points to the **Droid Receptacle** when calculating the amount healed (one-quarter of the total). Likewise, when you are healed by [*Vital Transfer*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vital_Transfer), [**Bolster Ally**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Inspiration_Talent_Tree), or similar abilities, you may add the Droid's Character Levels to your own to determine the amount healed.

#### **Cyborg Martyr**
*Prerequisite:* **Droid Receptacle**, **Shedding of the Body**

When you take damage, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you may transfer any amount of damage done to the **Droid Receptacle** to your Hit Points instead. You can also transfer any number of levels on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) to yourself as part of the [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). You may use this ability to lower the amount of damage below the Droid's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), for example. However, if the damage you absorb is above your own [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), you move -1 on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) as usual.

#### **Droid Receptacle**
*Prerequisite:* **Shedding of the Body**

B'omarr brain jars may be carried by a small **Droid Receptacle** (typically a modified [Arakyd BT-16 Security Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/BT-16_Perimeter_Security_Droid)). While the character's brain jar is carried, they are treated as piloting the **Droid Receptacle** as a Vehicle with [Total Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover). ([Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) skill checks and related [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) and [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) such as [Vehicular Combat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicular_Combat) apply and may even perform [Starship Maneuvers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Maneuvers).) Additionally this "Blindsight" allows you to ignore [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) (including [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment)) from darkness. However, you cannot perceive colors in total darkness.

#### **Enlightened Meditation**
*Prerequisite:* **Serene Courage**

You may enter a brief meditative state as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). You may remain in this trance as long as you wish, and you are still aware of your surroundings. However, you loses your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) during your meditation. Upon emerging from the trance (a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action)), you may roll your first skill check or attack roll made in the following round twice, keeping the better result.

#### **Serene Courage**
You are immune to [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Fear effects.
