Members of [The GenoHaradan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_GenoHaradan) are skilled not only in performing assassinations but also in manipulating others. An ancient organization dating back to the early days of the Republic, [The GenoHaradan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_GenoHaradan) are a clandestine group of assassins who pick their targets for political reason, though their true motives are rarely evident to those outside the organization.

#### **Deadly Repercussions**
When you reduce a target to 0 Hit Points or move the target to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), all your opponents within line of sight of both you and your target take a -2 penalty on attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Manipulating Strike **
Once per turn when you successfully damage a target with a non-[Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack), make an [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If successful, you can determine what the target does with its [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) on its next turn. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Improved Manipulating Strike**
*Prerequisite:* **Manipulating Strike** Talent

Whenever you successfully use the **Manipulating Strike** Talent, you determine what the target does with its [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) on its next turn. You cannot move an opponent into a [Hazard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazard) (such as into lava or off a cliff).

#### **Pulling the Strings **
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of a target within 12 squares. If you succeed, you move the target up to half its speed toward you through the safest route, and you make an immediate ranged or melee attack against the the target if it is within [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). You cannot move an opponent into a [Hazard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazard) (such as into lava or off a cliff).
