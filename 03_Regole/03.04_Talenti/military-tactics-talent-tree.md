*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

[Officers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Officers) study old battles, looking for historical examples of good military tactics. You are an expert at leading troops into battle, and using the battlefield to your advantage.

#### **Assault Tactics**
As a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you may designate a single creature or object as the target of an assault. If you succeed on a DC 15 [Knowledge (Tactics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Tactics)) check, you and all allies able to hear and understand you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to the target with each successful melee or ranged attack, until the start of your next turn. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Deployment Tactics**
You can use your tactical knowledge to direct allies in battle. As a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you can make a DC 15 [Knowledge (Tactics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Tactics)) check. If the check succeeds, you and any allies that can see, hear, and understand you gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls against [Flanked](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flanked) opponents, or a +1 dodge bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity) (character's choice). The bonus lasts until the start of your next turn. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

If you have the **[Born Leader](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Born_Leader)** Talent or the **[Battle Analysis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Analysis)** Talent, the bonus granted by this Talent increases to +2.

#### **Field Tactics**
*Prerequisite:* **Deployment Tactics**

You know how to use existing terrain to your best advantage. By using a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you can make a DC 15 [Knowledge (Tactics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Tactics)) check. If the check succeeds, you and all allies within 10 squares of you can use whatever [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) is available to gain a +10 [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (instead of the normal +5 [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonus). Allies must be able to hear and understand you to gain this benefit, and the bonus lasts until the start of your next turn. This Talent provides no benefit to anyone who doesn't have [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover). This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **One for the Team**
*Prerequisite:* **Deployment Tactics**

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can choose to take one-half or all of the damage dealt to an adjacent ally by a single attack. Similarly, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), an adjacent ally can choose to take one-half or all of the damage dealt to you by a single attack (even if they don't have this Talent).

#### **Outmaneuver**
*Prerequisites:* **Deployment Tactics**, **Field Tactics**

An [Officer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Officer) learns to counter the tactics of their enemies. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a DC 15 [Knowledge (Tactics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Tactics)) check. If the check succeeds, opponents in your line of sight lose all competence, insight, and morale bonuses on attack rolls, as well as any dodge bonuses to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), until the start of your next turn.

If one or more enemy [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/officer-candidacy-training.md|Officers]] are within your line of sight, the highest level [Officer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Officer) among them can attempt to [Oppose](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Oppose) your [Knowledge (Tactics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Tactics)) check as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). If their [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) result is higher than yours, your attempt to Outmaneuver your opponents fails.

#### **Shift Defense I**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can take a -2 penalty to one [Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense) ([Reflex](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex), [Fortitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude), or [Will](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will)) to gain a +1 competence bonus to another [Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense) until the start of your next turn.

#### **Shift Defense II**
*Prerequisite:* **Shift Defense I**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can take a -5 penalty to one [Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense) ([Reflex](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex), [Fortitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude), or [Will](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will)) to gain a +2 competence bonus to another [Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense) until the start of your next turn.

#### **Shift Defense III**
*Prerequisites:* **Shift Defense I**, **Shift Defense II**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can gain a +5 competence bonus to one [Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense) ([Reflex](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex), [Fortitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude), or [Will](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will)) by taking a -5 penalty to your other two [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses).

#### **Tactical Edge**
You can use the **Assault Tactics**, **Deployment Tactics**, or **Field Tactics** Talent as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), instead of a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) (provided you have the Talent in question).

- Reduce the Talent's DC by 5.
- Gain an additional +2 bonus to any bonus to attack, [Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense), or damage used by the Talent.
- Reduce the amount of damage taken by the character through the use of the Talent by 10 points.

Rerolls and other modifiers to the [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) skill apply normally to this check for all affected targets.
