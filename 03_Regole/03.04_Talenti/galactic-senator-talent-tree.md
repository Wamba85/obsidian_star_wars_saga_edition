*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

You are skilled with words and moving the minds of those around you to vote your way in the Senate. Your influence cannot be underestimated. 
#### **Diplomatic Poise**

Your calm and collected character are unflappable in any discussion over issues. Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you add a +5 competence bonus to your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).

#### **Living Memory**

Your recall of facts and events is photographic. Choose a specific [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill. With that skill, you may reroll those skill checks, keeping the better of the two results.

This Talent may be taken multiple times, but with a different [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill each time.

#### **Master of Will**

The force of your personality is unparalleled. In any contested [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception), [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception), or [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill check, any ties are automatically given to the player with this Talent. If both players have this Talent, whoever has the highest [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier will win. If those are the same, resolve the skill check normally.

#### **One Word, Two Meanings**

You can use your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check modifier instead of your [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) modifier when making [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill. If you are entitled to an [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check reroll, you may reroll your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check instead (Subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **When the Veils Move**

Your ability to perceive motives and intentions is very accurate. If combat is about to begin, make a DC 20 [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check. If successful, you gain a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) before [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) is rolled. You are also not considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) at the beginning of combat. Even if you fail the [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check, you are still not [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed).

#### **Willful Senator**
*Prerequisite:* **Diplomatic Poise**

The strength of your personality is incomparable. Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you may use your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) as your [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). This will also affect [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) until your next turn.
