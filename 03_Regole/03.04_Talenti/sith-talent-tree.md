*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

[The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith) tradition believes in order through tyranny. In ancient days, Sith Warriors battled Jedi Knights for galactic supremacy until, finally, the few remaining Sith were driven into hiding. Since then, [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith) have conspired to annihilate [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) and everything they stand for.

#### **Dark Healing**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to heal wounds by drawing life energy from another creature within 6 squares of you. Using this ability is a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), and you must succeed on a ranged attack roll. If the attack equals or exceeds the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), you deal 1d6 points of damage per Class Level to the target, and you heal an equal amount of damage. If the attack fails, there is no effect.

#### **Dark Scourge**
You have dedicated your life to wiping out the Jedi, and your hatred of them knows no bounds. Against Jedi characters (that is, characters belonging to [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi)), you gain a +1 [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side) bonus on attack rolls.

#### **Dark Side Adept**
[Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) that are strongly tied to [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) flow through you more easily. You can reroll any [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made when activating [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) with the [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] descriptor, but you must keep the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

#### **Dark Side Master**
*Prerequisite:* **Dark Side Adept**

[Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) that are strongly tied to the [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side) flow through you more easily. You can reroll any [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made when activating [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) with the [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] descriptor, and can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to keep the better of the two results.

#### **Force Deception**
You can use your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) modifier instead of your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check modifier when making [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) checks, as you use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to cloak your vile treachery. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) skill. If you are entitled to a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Improved Dark Healing**
*Prerequisite:* **Dark Healing**

Your **Dark Healing** Talent improves. The range of this ability increases to 12 squares, and even if that attack fails, the target takes half damage, while you heal an equal amount of damage.

#### **Wicked Strike**
*Prerequisites:* [Weapon Focus (Lightsabers)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Lightsabers)), **[Weapon Specialization (Lightsabers)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Specialization_(Lightsabers))**

When you score a critical hit with a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), you may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to move the target -2 steps along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

## Additional Sith Talents

#### **Affliction**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

Your [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) carries the taint of [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) more so than even other Dark Side users. When you damage a single opponent with one of your [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers), that target also takes 2d6 points of [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) damage at the beginning of its next turn, before taking any Actions.

#### **Dark Healing Field**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisites:* **Dark Healing**, **Improved Dark Healing**

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to heal wounds by drawing life energy from up to three targeted creatures within 12 squares of you. Once per encounter, you can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check. If the check result equals or exceeds a target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), the target takes 1d6 points of [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) damage per every [Sith Apprentice](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Apprentice) and [Sith Lord](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord) Class Level you possess.

You heal half the total damage dealt (cumulative from all targets). If the attack fails, the target takes half damage, and you heal that amount.

#### **Drain Force**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* **Affliction**

Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) when you damage a Force-sensitive opponent, the dark taint of your power allows you to sap some of the opponent's strength, and convert it to personal power, regaining one spent [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power). Additionally, the target loses one [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point).

#### **Sith Alchemy**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

Prerequisites: **Dark Side Adept**, **Dark Side Master**

Your knowledge of Sith sorcery allows you to imbue talismans and other objects with the power of the [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side).
- *Create Sith Talisman:* You can spend one [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to imbue a portable object with the [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side), creating a Sith Talisman that provides offensive strength to a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) or [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) attack. Creating the talisman takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).
    - While you wear or carry a Sith Talisman on your person, add 1d6 to damage rolls with your [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers). You increase your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by one when you first put on or carry a Sith Talisman.
    - You can only have one Sith Talisman active at any given time, and if it is destroyed, you cannot create another one for 24 hours.
- *Create Sith Weapon:* You can alchemically treat a properly prepared weapon to become a Sith Weapon. You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to imbue the weapon with the properties of the [Sith Alchemical Weapon Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Alchemical_Weapon_Template) (this process takes one hour to complete).

## Homebrew Sith Talents

#### **Force Crush**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

*Prerequisites:* Any One [Force Technique](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Technique), **Dark Side Adept**

Whenever you successfully activate a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] descriptor that causes the target to move down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), they gain a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition), which can only be removed if the target receives [Surgery](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surgery) (for living beings) or [Repairs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repairs) (for [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids), [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles), and objects).

Once per encounter, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to call upon the vengeful spirits of the ancient Sith. Doing so grants you 3 [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) with the [Vengeful Spirit Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vengeful_Spirit_Template). These [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) appear in any unoccupied square adjacent to you, and last until the end of the encounter (at which point they vanish).
