*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Jedi Order Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Jedi_Order_Campaign_Guide)*

<nowiki> </nowiki>The [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff) is the chosen weapon of the [Yuuzhan Vong](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong) Warrior Caste, though other Castes are known to utilise the weapon (excluding the Shaper Caste, whom are forbidden to use them or their progeny).

The following Talents allow you to improve your prowess with an [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff). These Talents may only be taken by [Yuuzhan Vong](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Yuuzhan_Vong) characters.Â 
#### **Amphistaff Block**
*Prerequisite:* [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +2

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you may negate a melee attack by making a successful [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check. The DC of the [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check is equal to the result of the attack roll you wish to negate, and you take a cumulative -5 penalty on your [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check for every time you have used **Amphistaff Block** since the beginning of your last turn.

You may use this to negate melee [Area Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks). If you succeed on the [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check, you take half damage if the attack hits, and no damage if the attack misses. You must have an [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff) drawn and in the Quarterstaff or Spear Forms to use this Talent. You must be aware of the attack and not be [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed).

#### **Amphistaff Riposte**
*Prerequisites:* **Amphistaff Block**, [Weapon Focus (Amphistaff)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Amphistaff)), [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +10

Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you may make an [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff) attack against a being whose attack you negated using the **Amphistaff Block** Talent. You cannot change the Form of the [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff) prior to making this attack (meaning, the attack can only be made with the Quarterstaff or Spear Forms of the weapon).

Only non-area melee attacks can be riposted in this manner; you cannot use this Talent when negating the damage from melee [Area Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks).

#### **Spearing Accuracy**
You treat an [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff) in Spear Form as a [Simple Weapon (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Ranged)), not a [Thrown](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown) Weapon, for the purposes of determining [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). Additionally, you may recall the thrown [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), but it does not return until the end of your next turn.

#### **Spiral Shower**
*Prerequisites:* [Weapon Focus (Amphistaff)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Amphistaff)), [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

You have learned how to extend the range of an Amphistaff's Spit Venom. The Spit Venom attack range is increased to 20 squares (instead of 10 square), but attacks made beyond 10 squares incur a -2 penalty on the attack roll.

#### **Venom Rake**
As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), if an attack you have made with the Whip Form of the [Amphistaff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Amphistaff) is negated (such as with the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** Talent) you may activate this Talent. You may reroll your attack, keeping the new result but your attack no longer causes damage.

If the result equals or exceeds both the targets [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), the target moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) as the Amphistaff's fangs graze the targets skin.
