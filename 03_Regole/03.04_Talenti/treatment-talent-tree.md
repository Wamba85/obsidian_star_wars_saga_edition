*Treatment Talent Tree data created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

You have learned to perform medical treatment in an exceptional manner. These techniques have allowed you to perform tasks more reliably and better than other healers.

#### **Back on their Feet**
*Prerequisite:* **Steady Hands**

After successfully performing the [Revivify](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Revivify) application of the [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) skill, the target of your [Revivify](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Revivify) gains a number of [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) equal to 5 + your Character Level. These [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) last until the end of the encounter (at which point any remaining [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) are lost), and any damage dealt to that target comes out of [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) first.
#### **Capable Assistant**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury)

When using the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action to aid a character with their [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check, you grant an additional +2 bonus for every 5 points by which you exceed the DC to assist.
#### **Makeshift Treatment**
*Prerequisite:* [Skill Focus (Treat Injury)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Treat_Injury))

You can attempt the [First Aid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid) application of the [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) skill without the use of a [Medpac](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Medpac). However, doing so imposes a -5 penalty to the check.
#### **Medical Specialization**
*Prerequisite:* [Skill Focus (Treat Injury)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Treat_Injury))

Choose a single method of medical treatment ([Treat Disease](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Disease), [Treat Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Poison), or [Treat Radiation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Radiation)).  You may choose to reroll any [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check to perform that application, keeping the better of the two results.

You may select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select this Talent, it applies to a different method of medical treatment.

#### **Reliable Treatment**
*Prerequisite:* **Steady Hands**

When performing the [First Aid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid) or [Heal Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heal_Damage) applications of the [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) skill, you may choose to reroll any [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check to perform that application, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
#### **Steady Hands**
*Prerequisite:* [Skill Focus (Treat Injury)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Treat_Injury))

Once per encounter as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), you reduce the [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) DC for all applications of the skill by your [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) modifier (minimum 1) until the start of your next turn. Additionally, when performing the [Critical Care](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_Care) application of the [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) skill, you take a -3 penalty to subsequent attempts at Critical Care in the last 24 hours, instead of the normal -5 penalty.
