*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue)*

You seek to overthrow the system and are adept at being a monkey wrench in the cogs of society, but often at the cost of others' rights, freedoms, and lives.
#### **Bomb Thrower**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics)

You are skilled in making and handling impromptu [Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Explosives). You gain a +5 bonus to [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) checks to [Handle Explosives](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Handle_Explosives). In addition, you can spend a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) to craft the equivalent of a [Frag Grenade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Frag_Grenade) from spare parts you have on hand. You must have access to the appropriate supplies, such as an old blaster, a [Tool Kit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tool_Kit), or materials found inside a hangar bay.
#### **For the Cause**
*Prerequisite:* **Make an Example**

Whenever you or an ally within 6 squares of you takes damage that exceeds that character’s [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), you and all allies within 6 squares of you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls until the end of your next turn.
#### **Make an Example**
Whenever you hit with an attack and deal enough damage to exceed a target’s [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), that target takes a -5 penalty to attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
#### **Revolutionary Rhetoric**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can do or say something that causes an enemy to doubt its motives. Choose one enemy within 12 squares and in your line of sight, and make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the target’s [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If you succeed, the target can take only [Move Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Actions) and [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if you attack the target. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
