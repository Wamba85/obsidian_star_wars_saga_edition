*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

In the days of the Old Republic, the fine art of swordplay was stylish among [Nobles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble). A particular style arose mixing martial precision with forceful panache.

#### **Noble Fencing Style**
*Prerequisites:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) and [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion)

This style of swordplay uses wit and force of personality to increase accuracy, taunting and distracting an opponent with feints, misdirection, and deception. When using a light melee weapon or a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) that you are proficient with, you can use your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier instead of your [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier on attack rolls.

#### **Demoralizing Defense**
*Prerequisite:* **Noble Fencing Style**

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can designate an enemy you have just hit with a melee attack. The enemy takes only half damage from the attack, but takes a -5 penalty on attacks made against you until the end of your next turn. A single target may only be affected by this Talent once per round. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect. 

#### **Leading Feint**
*Prerequisite:* **Noble Fencing Style**

Whenever you successfully damage an opponent with a melee attack, you can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check to [Feint](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feint) against that target as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). If successful, you designate an ally within 12 squares; your target is designated [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against the first attack that ally makes against your target before the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Personal Affront**
*Prerequisites:* **Noble Fencing Style**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can make a single melee attack against an adjacent enemy who just damaged you.

#### **Transposing Strike**
*Prerequisites:* **Noble Fencing Style**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

When you hit a character with a melee attack, you can choose to have the attack deal only half damage and switch places with that foe. Your foe must be no more than one size category larger than you, and you must end up occupying a space that was previously occupied by your target (And vice versa) to use this Talent. This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
