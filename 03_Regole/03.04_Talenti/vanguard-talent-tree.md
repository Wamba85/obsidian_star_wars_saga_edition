*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

As an expert in the art of scouting enemy formations, you are a valuable asset to any military force. Your ability to see what lies ahead on the battlefield is uncanny.

#### **Enhanced Vision**
When actively looking for hidden enemies, you can make a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) instead of a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action).

#### **Impenetrable Cover**
*Prerequisite:* **Maximize Cover**

Whenever you have [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) against a target, you gain [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) equal to your Class Level against that target until the start of your next turn, provided you still have [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from the target at the time the attack is made.

#### **Invisible Attacker**
*Prerequisite:* **Maximize Cover**

If your target is unaware of you, your ranged attacks deal +1 die of damage against that target.

#### **Mark the Target**
Whenever you damage a target with a non-[Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) ranged attack, you may designate one ally within your line of sight as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). Your target is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against that ally's first attack made before the start of your next turn.

#### **Maximize Cover**
When an opponent uses the [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) Action to negate your [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover), you can make a [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check opposed by the attacker's [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check. If successful, you retain your [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonus.

#### **Shellshock**
*Prerequisite:* **Soften the Target**

Whenever you damage a target that is unaware of you with an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack), that target is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) until the start of your next turn.

#### **Soften the Target**
Whenever you damage a target with a ranged attack, you may designate one ally within your line of sight as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). The ally you designate ignores the target's [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) and [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating) (if any) until the start of your next turn.

#### **Triangulate**
*Prerequisite:* **Enhanced Vision**

If you and at least one other ally have line of sight to and are aware of a target, you and all allies that can hear and understand you can reroll one ranged attack roll against that target, accepting the second result even if it is worse. You and your allies can only gain the benefits of this Talent once per encounter.
