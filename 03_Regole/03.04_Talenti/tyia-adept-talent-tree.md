*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

The masters of [The Tyia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tyia) seek out Harmony while eschewing Discord. A Tyia Adept connects to The Force in search of unity, and attempts to align their body and spirit with the galaxy. You must be a member of [The Tyia](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tyia) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Cycle of Harmony**
*Prerequisite:* **Tyia Adept**

When an ally within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight takes damage or moves down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by any means, you can designate a different ally within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

The ally you designate gain [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) equal to 5 + your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier (minimum +1). Damage is subtracted from [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) first, and any [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) remaining at the end of the encounter are lost.

#### **Force Stabilize**
*Prerequisite:* **Tyia Adept**

You can designate an ally within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight once per turn as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action); that ally immediately takes its [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind) if it has not yet done so in this encounter.

#### **Repel Discord**
Whenever you are targeted by a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] descriptor, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to give the creature that used that [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) against you a penalty on its [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to activate the power equal to its [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score).

#### **Stifle Conflict**
You can choose to have any [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) you activate deal [Stun Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Damage) instead of normal damage.

#### **Tyia Adept**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to designate one non-Droid ally within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight. Until the end of your next turn, whenever you or the targeted ally takes damage from any source, you take half of the damage and your ally takes half of the damage.

This halving of damage takes place before the damage is compared to your respective [Damage Thresholds](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Thresholds).
