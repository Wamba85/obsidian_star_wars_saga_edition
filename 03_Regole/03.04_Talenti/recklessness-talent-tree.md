*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You take risks that put you and your allies in danger but that always seem to pay off. Others call you reckless, but you know that great rewards come only from taking chances, even if they could be deadly.

#### **Find Openings**
Whenever you are missed by an attack, you gain a +2 morale bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.

#### **Hit the Deck**
Whenever you make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack), each ally in the area takes no damage if your attack roll fails to overcome his or her [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), and takes half damage if the attack hits.

#### **Lure Closer**
*Prerequisite:* **Trick Step**

Once per turn, as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of one enemy within 12 squares and within your line of sight. If you check results equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the target must move a number of squares equal to half its speed, and each square of movement must bring the target closer to you (though the target does avoid [Hazards](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazards) and obstacles).

If the target cannot avoid a [Hazard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazard) (such as a pit), it stops moving in the nearest safe square. This movement is considered involuntary and does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity). This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Risk for Reward**
*Prerequisite:* **Find Openings**

Once per turn, when an enemy damages you with an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity), you can make a single melee or ranged attack against a target in range as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

#### **Trick Step**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), make an [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check, opposed by the [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check of an enemy within your line of sight.

If your check result equals or exceeds the target's check, the target is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against the next attack you make before the end of your turn. If the target's check result is higher, you are considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against the next attack made by the target before the start of your next turn.
