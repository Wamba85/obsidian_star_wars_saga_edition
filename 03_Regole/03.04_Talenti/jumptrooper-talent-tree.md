*Jumptrooper Talent Tree data created by Wikia user Therysco.*

*See also: [Advanced Jet Pack Piloting Rules](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules)*

Most militaries call it the jumptrooper skill set.  Mandalorian warriors prefer the more poetic rising phoenix.  Whatever it’s called in setting, though, the Jumptrooper Talent Tree includes all the learning needed to transform your awkward jet-aided bounces into fast and prolonged flight.

**Special:** This Talent Tree incorporates all the talents from the Rocket Jumper Talent Tree except for Jet Pack Training, which is partly covered by Hair-Trigger Throttle (see below).  Their prerequisites have changed accordingly.

#### Jumptrooper Training
*Prerequisite:* Trained in [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot)

Your skills with the flight controls have improved enough that you waste little fuel.  Double the amount of charges that you can get out of a jet pack’s fuel cell - for you, a full fuel cell usually supplies 20 charges.

Though still shaky with high-speed maneuvers, you can use some in short bursts.  If your jet pack is activated, then by burning 2 charges, spending a swift action, and succeeding on a Pilot Check, DC 20, you can double your fly speed during one move action this turn.  If your check fails, your swift action and charges are wasted.  If and when you gain your Jumptrooper Qualification, you lose this speed boost maneuver.

#### Jumptrooper Qualification
*Prerequisites:* Jumptrooper Training, trained in [Endurance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance)

You’ve achieved the minimum proficiency with jet packs expected of jumptroopers.  You replace the normal rules for [Jet Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jet_Pack) use from its Saga Edition equipment entry with the [Advanced Jet Pack Piloting house rules](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules).

You’re used to carrying your jet pack on your back for hours while performing other physically demanding tasks.  Your jet pack counts only a third of its weight towards your [Encumbrance and Carrying Capacity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Encumbrance).

#### Burning Assault
*Prerequisite:* None

Refer to the talent of the same name from the [Rocket Jumper Talent Tree](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Jumper_Talent_Tree#Burning_Assault), though when using [Advanced Jet Pack Piloting Rules](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules), this maneuver requires 2 charges.

#### Emergency Maneuvers
*Prerequisite:* Jumptrooper Qualification

It only takes one piloting mistake, mechanical malfunction, or lucky shot to turn your pleasure flight into a death trap.  However, you regularly practice emergency maneuvers to better the odds that you can walk away from snafus alive and uninjured.

**Avoid Collisions** - You can always attempt to [Avoid a Collision](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid_Collision) for half damage.  If you were permitted to avoid a collision without this talent, you instead take half-damage on a failure and no damage on a success.

**Crash Landings** - If you’re [Crash Landing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Landing) and your jet pack has at least 1 charge left, then as a reaction, you burn 1 charge and cause [Falling Damage’s](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Damage) attack roll against you to automatically fail, halving the damage you receive.

**Extended Sputters** - You’ve learned a few throttle tricks that can extend the duration of your jet pack’s [Sputtering](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Sputtering) state from one turn to two consecutive turns.  However, if you use these tricks, you can’t use any move actions to gain altitude during this sputter.

**Mobility** - You satisfy the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dodge.md|Dodge]] prerequisite for the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/mobility.md|Mobility Feat]].

**Reflexive Tilting** - Your effortless adjustments in flight just by shifting weight make you a little more elusive than when you're on the ground.  While airborne and with your jet pack Active, you gain a dodge bonus of +1 to your Reflex Defense.  This bonus stacks with other applicable dodge bonuses, and you lose all dodge bonuses when you would lose a Dexterity bonus to your Reflex Defense.

**Rough Landings** - You automatically succeed on your piloting check to land while [Sputtering](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Sputtering) or moving [Full-Throttle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Full-Throttle_Mode_(Move_Action,_1_charge)).  Also, if you’re conscious when landing with a deployed [Emergency Chute](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Emergency_Chute), you take no damage from falling and aren’t knocked prone.

#### Escape Speed
*Prerequisite:* Emergency Maneuvers, BAB +6

Once per round, if something [Grabs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) you and you have 6 squares of vertical space above you, then as an immediate reaction (including before any [Grapple Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple)), you can burn 3 charges to instantly escape the grab, ending your movement 6 squares up.

Beings with Intelligence 2 or more can choose to try to maintain their grab: as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions), they can make a second [Grab Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab).  If the weight of your equipment + your target + their equipment doesn’t exceed twice your [Carrying Capacity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Encumbrance), you drag them with you 6 squares up (they can use a free action to let go at any point in this ascent).  However, if the weight exceeds twice your carrying capacity, you remain grabbed and stationary.

If you're airborne and still grabbed, you can't automatically escape the grab on your turn.  You must succeed on a contested grapple check.  If you win, the grab ends and they either fall or activate their own fly speed as a reaction.  If they win, the grab is maintained.  Neither side may use grapple maneuvers (e.g., Trip, Pin).

#### Hair-Trigger Throttle
You can Activate your jet pack with a free action on your turn or at the start of a [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise) if you’re not surprised.  If you have your Jumptrooper Qualification, you can also activate [Full-Throttle Mode](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Full-Throttle_Mode_(Move_Action,_1_charge)) in the same turn that you [Activate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Activate_(Swift_Action,_1_charge)) your jet pack.

#### Improved Trajectory
*Prerequisite:* Jumptrooper Qualification

Refer to the talent of the same name from the [Rocket Jumper Talent Tree](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Jumper_Talent_Tree#Improved_Trajectory), but the speed bonus applies only when in [Hover and Sweep Mode](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Hover_and_Sweep_Mode_(Move_Action,_no_charges)).

#### Jet Pack Withdraw
*Prerequisite:* Jumptrooper Qualification

Refer to the talent of the same name from the [Rocket Jumper Talent Tree](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Jumper_Talent_Tree#Jet_Pack_Withdraw).

#### Shell Splitter
*Prerequisites:* Emergency Maneuvers, BAB +6

Like a carrion crow, you can grab your prey, gain altitude, and drop them to the ground.

Once per encounter, if you still have your three actions available (Swift, Standard, Move) on your current turn and 12 squares of vertical space above you, then as a standard action, you can attempt a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) per normal rules except that you don’t provoke an Attack of Opportunity and your attack penalty is only -2.  If you succeed, as long as the weight of your equipment + your target + their equipment doesn’t exceed twice your [Carrying Capacity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Encumbrance), you immediately spend your move action to burn 4 charges and drag your target 12 squares straight up, then spend your swift action to release the target in a square next to you - these follow up actions can’t be delayed. You cause 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the rough handling.

Instead of a grab, you can ranged grab with appropriate equipment (e.g., [Snare Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Snare_Pistol), [Whipcord](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Whipcord), [Shock Whip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shock_Whip)), but the target must be within 2 squares range.

Your released target doesn’t fall to the ground until the beginning of your next turn, giving them and their allies a chance to prevent the worst outcome.  (E.g., they could activate their own fly speed on their turn.)  Otherwise, the GM determines the target’s [Falling Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Falling_Damage) for 18 meters at the beginning of your turn using normal rules.

#### Strafe and Splash
*Prerequisite:* Jumptrooper Qualification

[Full-Throttle Mode](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#Full-Throttle_Mode_(Move_Action,_1_charge)) no longer applies a -2 attack penalty.

When you’re in [All-Out Movement Mode](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Jet_Pack_Piloting_Rules#All-Out_Movement_Mode_(Full-Round_Action,_2_charges)), as a free action once per turn, you may make one ranged attack with a pistol, rifle, or jet pack integrated missile launcher.  This attack has a -2 penalty.
