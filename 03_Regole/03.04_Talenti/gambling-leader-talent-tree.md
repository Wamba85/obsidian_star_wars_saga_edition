*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You aren't afraid to take chances when leading your allies, and you risk defeat in exchange for a shot at even the most unlikely victories. You put yourself on the front lines to encourage your allies to overcome long odds.

#### **Assault Gambit**
Once per turn, as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can designate one ally and one enemy that have line of effect to each other. The ally and the enemy make opposed [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) checks, and the winner can make a single immediate melee or ranged attack against the loser. No character can benefit from this Talent more than once per round.

#### **Direct Fire**
*Prerequisite*: **Assault Gambit**

Once per encounter, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate one ally and one target that does not have [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from you. Until the start of your next turn, the ally you designate ignores the target's [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonuses to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense).

#### **Face the Foe**
If you do not have [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from a target, you gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls against that target.

#### **Lead From the Front**
*Prerequisite*: **Face the Foe**

If you do not have [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from a target that you damaged with a ranged attack, all your allies gain a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls against that target and a +5 circumstance bonus to opposed [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) checks against that target until the start of your next turn.

#### **Luck Favors the Bold**
*Prerequisite*: **Face the Foe**

If at least one enemy within your line of sight is aware of you and you do not have [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) against that enemy, at the start of your turn if you are conscious you gain a number of [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) equal to 5 + one-half your Heroic Level. Damage is subtracted from [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) first, and any [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) remaining at the end of the encounter are lost. [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) do not stack.
