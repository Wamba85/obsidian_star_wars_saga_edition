*Mechanic Talent Tree created by Wikia user Darth borehd.*

Your skill in mechanics allows you to better utilize and modify a variety of mechanical and electrical devices.

#### **Engineering Savant**
*Prerequisite: *[Skill Focus (Mechanics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Mechanics))

While working as the [Engineer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Engineer) of a Colossal or smaller [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), you may replace the Vehicle's [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) modifier with your own (changing the Vehicle's Weapon Systems' modifiers appropriately).

#### **Enhance Implant**
*Prerequisites: *[[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/cybernetic-surgery.md|Cybernetic Surgery]], [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer)

You can modify certain [Implants](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Implants). These are enhanced for the same cost as a normal use of the [Tech Specialist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_Specialist) Feat. An upgraded Implant provides one of the following benefits:
- An upgraded [Bio-Stabilizer Implant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bio-Stabilizer_Implant) grants immunity to [Diseases](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Diseases).
- An upgraded [Memory Implant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Memory_Implant) allows the user to take any one of the Logic Upgrade [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats):
    - [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/logic-upgrade-self-defense.md|Logic Upgrade: Self-Defense]]
    - [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/logic-upgrade-tactician.md|Logic Upgrade: Tactician]]
    - [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/logic-upgrade-skill-swap.md|Logic Upgrade: Skill Swap]]
- An upgraded [Sensory Implant](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sensory_Implant) provides Darkvision to the user (instead of instead of Low-Light Vision).

#### **Identify Droid**
*Prerequisite: *[Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Technology)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Technology))

You use your experience in mechanics to recall a Droid's traits and abilities. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can select a single [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) within line of sight and make a [Knowledge (Technology)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Technology)) check against a DC equal to 15 + the Droid's CL. If the check is successful, you immediately learn any two (your choice) of the following pieces of information:

- Droid's [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) or attack bonus with a particular attack
- Any one of the Droid's [Defense Scores](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Scores)
- Any one of the Droid's [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) modifier
- The presence of any one [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) or [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) (you choose the [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) or [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), and the Gamemaster reveals whether or not it is present)
#### **Modify Prosthetic**
*Prerequisites: *[Skill Focus (Mechanics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Mechanics)), [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/cybernetic-surgery.md|Cybernetic Surgery]], **Patient Builder**

You may upgrade a [Cybernetic Prosthesis](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cybernetic_Prosthesis) just as you would any other item via the [Tech Specialist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_Specialist) Feat, using any of the following benefits:
- *Enhanced Dexterity:* The limb provides a +1 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on all [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity)-based skill checks.
- *Enhanced Strength: *The limb provides a +1 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on all [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength)-based skill checks.
- *Enhanced Capability:* The limb provides a +1 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on all [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) and [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) checks.

#### **Patch Job**
*Prerequisite:* **[Quick Fix](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Quick_Fix)**

Once per encounter, you may use the [Jury-Rig](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jury-Rig) application of the [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) skill as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) instead of a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

#### **Patient Builder**
*Prerequisites: *[Skill Focus (Mechanics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Mechanics))

While using the [Build Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Build_Object) action, you can [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) checks. Additionally, when assembling the object you reduce the Object's Size Multiplier by half.
#### **Skilled Mechanic**
*Prerequisite: *[Skill Focus (Mechanics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Mechanics))

You may reroll [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) checks, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.
#### **Technological Master**
*Prerequisites: *[Skill Focus (Mechanics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Mechanics)), [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/gearhead.md|Gearhead]], **Engineering Savant**, **Patient Builder**

When you use the [Tech Specialist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_Specialist) feat on a weapon or suit of armor that you are proficient with, or a device, [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), or [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) that you are familiar with (GM's call), you may pay twice as much for the parts to add the trait, but the trait does not count towards the one-per-item limit of traits.

You cannot apply the same trait to the same item twice, and you may only use this Talent once per item that you upgrade.
