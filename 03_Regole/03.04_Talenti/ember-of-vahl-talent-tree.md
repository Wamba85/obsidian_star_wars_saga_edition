Members of Vahl's cult look to their goddess for inspiration. Over the years, they have developed talents that slant toward the destructive. You must be a member of [The Ember of Vahl](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ember_of_Vahl) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Initiate of Vahl**
Having been formally initiated into Vahl's priesthood, you are resistant to the effects of [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) and [Extreme Heat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extreme_Heat). You take half damage from attacks that deal [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage, or no damage on a miss (if the [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage is part of an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack)).

#### **Reading the Flame**
*Prerequisite:* **Initiate of Vahl**

You can enter a trance by staring into a flame of any size, gaining insight into the workings of the galaxy by meditating on the flame's movement. Whenever you use the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power or the [Search Your Feelings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Search_Your_Feelings) application of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill, you can reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Sword of Vahl**
*Prerequisite:* **Initiate of Vahl**

Your devotion to Vahl allows you to eschew advanced weapons in favor of simple implements of war. You gain a +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus on attack rolls made with [Simple Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapons).

#### **Vahl's Brand**
*Prerequisite:* **[Empower Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Empower_Weapon)**

Any additional damage you deal with an **[Empowered Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Empowered_Weapon)** is considered to be [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage.

#### **Vahl's Flame**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to call forth the sparks of your goddess, wreathing your weapon in flames. Until the beginning of your next turn, any successful attack you make with a Melee Weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of [Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fire) damage.
