*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

You have dedicated your life as a Jedi to preserving knowledge and applying it in times when it is needed.

#### **Direct**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can return one spent [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) to the [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) of any ally within 6 squares of you and in your line of sight. The [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) must have been spent by the ally you designate.

#### **Impart Knowledge**
*Prerequisite:* **[Skilled Advisor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skilled_Advisor)**

You can [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) on the [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) checks of an ally within 6 squares of you as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) for [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skills you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in.

#### **Insight of the Force**
You can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check in place of a [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) check for any [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill you are not [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in that [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill for the purposes of using this Talent. If you are entitled to a [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) check reroll, you can reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Master Advisor**
*Prerequisite:* **[Skilled Advisor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skilled_Advisor)**

When you use the **[Skilled Advisor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skilled_Advisor)** Talent, the ally you aid gains one temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) at the end of their next turn. If the [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) is not spent before the end of the encounter, it is lost.

#### **Scholarly Knowledge**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can reroll a [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) check and keep the better of the two results. This can be used with any [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in.
