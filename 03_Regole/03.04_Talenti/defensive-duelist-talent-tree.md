*Defensive Duelist Talent Tree created by Wikia user Chellewalker.*

Taking sanctuary in your mastery of technique and parrying, you have honed your dueling ability to maximize your defenses.

#### **Defensive Stance**
When [Fighting Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Defensively), you gain a bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) equal to half your Class Level (rounded down).
#### **Expert Parry**
*Prerequisite:* **Defensive Stance**

Once per encounter as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to a melee attack made against you, you gain a [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) score equal to your [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) against that attack.
#### **Masterful Footwork**
*Prerequisite:* **Steady Strike**

You are always considered to be engaged in melee combat for the purposes of ranged attacks made against you, inflicting a -5 penalty to such attacks without the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/precise-shot.md|Precise Shot]] feat.
#### **Repositioning Shift**
As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to a failed melee attack made against you while [Fighting Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Defensively), you can move a single square in any direction. This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
#### **Steady Strike**
A number of times per encounter equal to your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) modifier (minimum 1), you can make a single melee attack as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) when [Fighting Defensively](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Defensively). You cannot make an attack in this way more than once per round.
