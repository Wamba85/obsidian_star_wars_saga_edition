*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

Your mother always said you were trouble. Now, your enemies know it, too.

#### **Dastardly Strike**
Whenever you make a successful attack against an opponent that is denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), the target moves -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). This Talent can be used only against characters, not objects or [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles).

#### **Disruptive**
By spending two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions), you can use your knack for causing trouble and instigating chaos to disrupt your enemies. Until the start of your next turn, you suppress all morale and insight bonuses applied to enemies in your line of sight.

#### **Skirmisher**
If you move at least 2 squares before you attack and end your move in a different square from where you started, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. You gain the benefit of this Talent with [Weapon Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems) only if you are the Vehicle's [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)).

#### **Sneak Attack**
Any time your opponent is [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) or otherwise denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with a successful melee or ranged attack. You must be within 6 squares of the target to make a **Sneak Attack** with a ranged weapon.

You may select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select it, your **Sneak Attack** damage increases by +1d6 (Maximum +10d6).

#### **Walk the Line**
*Prerequisite:* **Disruptive**

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can do or say something that catches your enemies off guard. All opponents within 6 squares of you, and within your line of sight take a -2 penalty to their [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) until the start of your next turn. The penalty is negated if line of sight is broken.

This Talent has a range of 6 squares at [Starship Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Scale).

## Additional Misfortune Talents

#### **Backstabber**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

*Prerequisite:* **Sneak Attack**

You can take advantage of your adversary's distractions, no matter how momentary or fleeting. Once per turn, when you [Flank](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flank) a target, you can treat that target as if they were [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) for one of your attacks.

#### **Befuddle**

If you succeed on a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check against a target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), until the start of your next turn you can move though the [Threatened Area](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Threatened_Area) of that target as part of your [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) without provoking an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity).

Each [Threatened](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Threatened) square that you move through counts as 2 squares of movement.

#### **Cunning Strategist**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

*Prerequisites:* **Disruptive**, **Walk the Line**

You can create opportunities to chip away at our opponents' defenses. You can use each of the following actions once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action):
- *Create Opening:* Make a single melee or ranged attack against any target within your [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). If you damage the target, the target takes a -5 penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the start of your next turn.
- *Crippling Attack:* Make a single melee or ranged attack against any target within your [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). Until the start of your next turn, the target takes a -2 penalty to their base speed.

#### **Hesitate**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

You can fill your opponent with doubt by making a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) against a single target that can hear and understand you within 12 squares of you. If your check result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the target takes a -2 penalty to its base speed, and if the target takes a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), it must also spend its [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action).

This penalty lasts until the end of the target's next turn.

You excel at seduction through deception. If you fail a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check to change a target's [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude), you can immediately reroll the check using your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) skill in lieu of your [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill. You must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

#### **Seize Object**

Once per encounter as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you can attempt to seize a held, carried, or worn object from an adjacent target by making a [Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm) attack, with a +10 bonus on your attack roll.

If the attack succeeds, you are now holding the object, and you cannot use this Talent in place of the [Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disarm) Action. You cannot conceal the use of this Talent from the target.

If the check result equals or exceeds an enemy's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that enemy must spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) in addition to a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to make an attack until the start of your next turn.

#### **Stymie**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

Once per round, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate a target within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight as the target of this Talent. Until the beginning of your turn, you can cause that target to take a -5 penalty on all checks made with a single [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill).

You must have line of sight to your target to make use of this Talent, and declare which [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) is to be penalized at the time this Talent is activated. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
