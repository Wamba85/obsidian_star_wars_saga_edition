Smuggling is part skill, part talent, and part luck. The most notorious smugglers in the galaxy get along by making use of their quick wits and savvy.

#### **Art of Concealment**
Some smugglers are adept at hiding contraband and weapons, even on their person. When making a [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check to [Conceal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Conceal) an item, you can [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) even under pressure. Additionally, you can [Conceal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Conceal) an item as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action).

#### **Fast Talker**
*Prerequisite:* **Art of Concealment**

Smugglers must be quick to explain discrepancies in their cover stories. Once per day, you can [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) when attempting to [Deceive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deceive).

#### **Hidden Weapons**
*Prerequisite:* **Art of Concealment**

If you draw a concealed weapon and, before the end of the same round, make an attack against a target that failed to notice the item, the target is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against you. You can draw a concealed item or a stowed item as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action). Additionally, if you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/quick-draw.md|Quick Draw]] feat, you can reduce this to a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action).

#### **Illicit Dealings**
Smugglers have a knack for locating and negotiating illicit deals. When using [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) to [Haggle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Haggle) for [Restricted](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Restricted), [Military](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Military), or [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal) goods you may roll twice, keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Surprise Strike**
Sometimes a smuggler has to fight his way out of a bad situation. If you fail any [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check to convey deceptive information, you can initiate combat and make a single [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) in the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round) (or with a melee or ranged weapon, if you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/quick-draw.md|Quick Draw]] feat); all other combatants are considered [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised) even if they are aware of you.
