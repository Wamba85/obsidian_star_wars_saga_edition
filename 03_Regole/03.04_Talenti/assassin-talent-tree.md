You do not fight fair. If you are ever caught in a straightforward fight, the odds are you are not going to make it, so your best move is to set up your attacks and use every trick at your disposal.

#### **Advantageous Positioning**
*Prerequisite:* **Shift**

Any opponent that you are [Flanking](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flanking) is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) and is denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against you.

#### **Get Some Distance**
*Prerequisites:* **Advantageous Positioning**, **Shift**

Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) you can make a melee attack against a target and then move up to your speed away from that target. This movement does not provoke an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity).

#### **Murderous Arts I**
When your successful attack causes an opponent to move -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), that opponent immediately takes an additional +1d6 damage.

#### **Murderous Arts II**
*Prerequisite:* **Murderous Arts I**

Whenever you successfully hit an opponent that you have [Marked](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Marked), your melee and ranged attack attacks deal an additional +1d6 damage.

#### **Ruthless**
Once per encounter, when you drop a foe to 0 Hit Points or push an opponent to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), you can immediately take a bonus [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action).

#### **Shift**
As a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you can move 1 square without provoking an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity).

#### **Sniping Assassin**
When you make a ranged attack against a target that is not at Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), you add half your Class Level to your damage roll.

#### **Sniping Marksman**
*Prerequisite:* **Sniping Assassin**

Once per encounter, when you make a ranged attack against a target that is not at Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range), you can ignore your target's Armor bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense).

#### **Sniping Master**
*Prerequisites:* **Sniping Assassin**, **Sniping Marksman**

By taking only a single [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) at a target that is not within Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).
