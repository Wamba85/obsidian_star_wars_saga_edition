*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

Hunting Jedi is big business during [The Legacy Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legacy_Era), as the Sith-controlled Empire pays well for captured Jedi. However, given their powers and skills, Jedi are among the most dangerous prey for [Bounty Hunters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty_Hunters) to pursue.

#### **Force Blank**
You are especially hard to detect using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Attempts to detect you using the [Sense Surroundings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Surroundings) aspect of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill suffer a -10 penalty.

#### **Lightsaber Evasion**
Whenever an enemy misses you with a melee attack with a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), you may move up to 2 squares in any direction. This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).

#### **Precision Fire**
The Jedi are skilled at blocking and deflecting ranged attacks with their [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers), and you are able to compensate for this to some degree by taking careful shots. Whenever you [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) before making a ranged attack, you increase the difficulty of **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)** attempts to negate your attack by +5.

#### **Steel Mind**
If you resist the effects of a [*[Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting)*] Force Power, the user of that [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) cannot attempt to use the same [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) against you for the remainder of the encounter.

#### **Strong-Willed**
You are trained to resist Jedi mind tricks. You add your Class Level to your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks.

#### **Telekinetic Resistance**
Whenever you are targeted by a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that moves you, you reduce the distance you are moved by half.
