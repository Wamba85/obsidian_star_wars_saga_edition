*Prerequisites:* **Siang Lance Mastery**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +7

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to empower a [Siang Lance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Siang_Lance), which takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). After the [Siang Lance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Siang_Lance) in empowered, it deals an additional die of damage when you wield it. Others who wield the weapon do not gain the bonus damage die.

#### **Shield Gauntlet Defense**
Once per turn as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can gain a +2 deflection bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against any one ranged attack. To use this Talent, you must be wearing an active [Shield Gauntlet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Gauntlet), you must be aware of the attack, and you must not be [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed).

#### **Shield Gauntlet Deflect**
*Prerequisite:* **Shield Gauntlet Defense**

Once per round as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can negate a ranged attack by making a successful [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check. The DC of the skill check is equal to the result of the attack roll you wish to negate. To use this this Talent, you must be wearing an active [Shield Gauntlet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Gauntlet), you must be aware of the attack, and you must not be [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed). You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to use this Talent to negate a ranged attack against an adjacent character.

You can use **Shield Gauntlet Deflect** to deflect some of the barrage of shots fired from a ranged weapon set on [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire). If your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check succeeds, you take half damage if the attack hits an no damage if the attack misses.

#### **Shield Gauntlet Redirect**
*Prerequisites:* **Shield Gauntlet Defense**, **Shield Gauntlet Deflect**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

This Talent allows you to redirect a deflected blaster bolt along a specific trajectory so that it damages another creature or object in its path. When you successfully perform a **Shield Gauntlet Deflect**, you can make an immediate ranged attack against another target within 6 squares of you which you have line of sight. If the attack succeeds, it deals normal weapon damage to the target.

Only single blaster bolts can be redirected in this manner. You cannot use this Talent to redirect barrages from [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) weapons and other types of projectiles. To use this Talent, you must be wearing an active [Shield Gauntlet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Gauntlet), you must be aware of the attack, and you must not be [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed).

#### **Siang Lance Mastery**
You treat a [Siang Lance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Siang_Lance) as a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle) instead of as an [Exotic Weapon (Ranged)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Ranged)). Additionally, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with a [Siang Lance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Siang_Lance). This Talent counts as the [Weapon Focus (Siang Lance)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Siang_Lance)) feat for the purpose of satisfying prerequisites.

If you also have the [Weapon Focus (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Rifles)) feat, the attack bonus provided by this Talent does not stack with the attack bonus provided by [Weapon Focus (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Rifles)).
