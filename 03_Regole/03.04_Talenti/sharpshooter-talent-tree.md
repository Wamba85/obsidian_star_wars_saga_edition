*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

You are an expert at long-range combat, using the inherent advantage of a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle) to win the day.

#### **Precision Shot**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/far-shot.md|Far Shot]]

When using the [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) Action, you gain the benefit of the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/point-blank-shot.md|Point-Blank Shot]] feat against your target, regardless of [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) category.

#### **Bullseye**
*Prerequisites:* **Draw a Bead**, **Precision Shot**, [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/sniper.md|Sniper]]

Once per encounter, you can designate a single target that you have [Aimed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aimed) at and is not within Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). When making a ranged attack roll against that target, the target is denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) when determining the effect of your attack.

#### **Draw a Bead**
*Prerequisites:* **Precision Shot**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +10

Once per round, you can spend a single [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to designate a single enemy who is not within Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). When you make a successful ranged attack roll that deals damage against the designated enemy, add your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus (minimum +1) to the damage roll.

This effect lasts until the target is unconscious, dead, or leaves your line of sight. You can have only one enemy designated in this manner.

#### **Pinning Shot**
*Prerequisite:* **Precision Shot**

You can keep your target worrying about where the next shot is coming from instead of trying to flee. When you deal damage to an enemy that you have [Aimed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aimed) at, the target's speed is reduced to 2 squares, and the target cannot take either a Double [Move](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move) Action or use the [Run](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Run) Action until the end of your next turn.

This is a [Stunning](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stunning) effect.

#### **Harrying Shot**
*Prerequisites:* **Pinning Shot**, **Precision Shot**

When you make a successful ranged attack against an enemy that you have [Aimed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aimed) at and the attack deals damage, the target cannot use a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to make an attack roll on his or her next turn. This is a [Stunning](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stunning) effect.
