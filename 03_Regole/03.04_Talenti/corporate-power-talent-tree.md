*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

You are an extension of your corporation, and wield their power as your own.

#### **Competitive Drive**
You are driven to compete and succeed. Once per encounter, you can reroll any [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom)-, [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence)-, or [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma)-based Skill Check (except [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force)), keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Competitive Edge**
When you and your allies are not [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised), you and a number of allies equal to your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier (minimum 1), which you designate on your first turn, gain the benefits of the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/quick-draw.md|Quick Draw]] feat for the remainder of the encounter.

#### **Corporate Clout**
*Prerequisites:* **Impose Hesitation**, **Wrong Decision**

You are adept at making deals that make opponents question which side they should be on. Once per encounter, as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of an opponent within line of sight.

If your check equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the target cannot attack you for the remainder of the encounter. If your check exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) by 5 or more, the target will not attack you or your allies for the remainder of the encounter.

If your check exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) by 10 or more, the target's [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) toward you is now [Friendly](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Friendly), and the target becomes your ally for the remainder of the encounter, remaining under the control of the Gamemaster. If you or one of your allies attacks the target, the target once again becomes [Hostile](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hostile).

If the target is a higher level than you, it gains a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Fear effect.

#### **Impose Confusion**
*Prerequisite:* **Impose Hesitation**

Increase the area of **Impose Hesitation** to a 12-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone). Also, once per encounter, after making the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check for **Impose Hesitation**, you can instead choose to have the targets lose a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) on their next turn.

#### **Impose Hesitation**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check targeting all opponents within a 6-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone). If you equal or exceed the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the target loses a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) on its next turn, and cannot take [Full-Round Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Actions).

Targets need to see, hear, and understand you to be affected by this attack. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Willful Resolve**
Once per encounter, you can negate the effects of a single attack roll or [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) made against you that targets your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).

#### **Wrong Decision**
Each time you are attacked, the opponent that attacked you takes a -2 morale penalty to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) until the end of your next turn. This penalty is not cumulative, so if a target makes multiple attacks against you it only incurs the penalty once per turn.
