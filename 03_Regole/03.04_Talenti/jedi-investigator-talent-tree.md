*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

You are one of The Jedi Order's most trusted investigators, tasked with ferreting out truth through a combination of detective work and Force Divination.

#### **Echoes of the Force**
*Prerequisite:* *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*

You can use the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power on a location instead of on an individual creature, peering into the location's past to view events that occurred there. Unlike the normal use of the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power, you are actually looking into the location's past (at a time you designate), and you must be standing in the location being viewed.

The target DC for your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check is 20, +1 for each day into the past that you are attempt to scry. When you look into the past, you need only specify a time in a number of days, as you can sense tremors in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) that focus you visions on meaningful events that day.

#### **Jedi Quarry**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate a single target creature as the focus of your attentions. You gain a +2 bonus to your Speed any time you spend a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) to [Move](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move), provided that you end your movement adjacent to the target.

You retain this bonus (and may not use this Talent again) until your target surrenders, is reduced to 0 Hit Points, moves to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), or until the encounter ends.

#### **Prepared for Danger**
*Prerequisite:* *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*

Whenever you have at least one unspent *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power in your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite), you can spend that *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power to regain any one other [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action).

#### **Sense Deception**
Whenever someone makes a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) or [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) Skill Check against your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), you can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, replacing your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) with the result of your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check if it is higher.

#### **Unclouded Judgement**
*Prerequisite:* **Sense Deception**

Whenever you are the target of a Mind-Affecting [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) or [Force Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Talent), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to negate the effects of that [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) or [Force Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Talent) (no [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) required).
