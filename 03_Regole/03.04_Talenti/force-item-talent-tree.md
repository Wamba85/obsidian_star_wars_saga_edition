*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

You can imbue weapons and objects with the power of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force).

#### **Attune Weapon**
You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to attune a melee weapon. Attuning the weapon takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). From that point forward, whenever you wield the attuned weapon, you gain a +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus on attack rolls.

The weapon is attuned to you alone; others who wield the weapon do not gain the [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus.

#### **Empower Weapon**
You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to empower a melee weapon. Empowering the weapon takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). From that point forward, the Empowered Weapon deals an additional die of damage, but only when wielded by you.

For example, an empowered [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) deals 3d8 points of damage, instead of 2d8 points of damage. Others who wield the weapon do not gain the bonus damage die.

#### **Force Talisman**
You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to imbue a weapon or some other portable object with [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), creating a Talisman that provides protection to you. Creating the Talisman takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

While you wear or carry the Talisman on your person, you gain a +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to one of your [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) ([Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), or [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense)).

You may only have one **Force Talisman** active at a given time, and if your **Force Talisman** is destroyed, you may not create another **Force Talisman** for 24 hours.

#### **Greater Force Talisman**
*Prerequisite: ***Force Talisman**

You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to imbue a weapon or some other portable object with [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), creating a Talisman that provides protection to you. Creating the Talisman takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

While you wear or carry the Talisman on your person, you gain a +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to all of your [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) ([Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), and [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense)).

You may only have one **Greater Force Talisman** active at a given time, and if your **Greater Force Talisman** is destroyed, you may not create another **Greater Force Talisman** (or regular **Force Talisman**) for 24 hours.

## Additional Force Item Talents

#### **Focused Force Talisman**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* **Force Talisman**

When you create a **Force Talisman**, you can select a single [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) from your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite). Whenever you are wearing this **Focused Force Talisman** and activate the selected [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to immediately regain all your expended uses of that spent [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), adding it to your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite).

#### **Force Throw**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite: ***Empower Weapon**

You can hurl [Simple Weapons (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapons_(Melee)), or [Advanced Melee Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapons) your size or smaller as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), treating it as a [Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown_Weapon). The [Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown_Weapon) deals normal weapon damage if it hits.

If the weapon deals piercing or slashing damage, it becomes embedded in your target, remaining there and causing an additional die of damage each round at the end of the target's turn, and also when it is removed (removing the embedded weapon is a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), and an adjacent ally can remove the embedded weapon for you).

Your target must be within 6 squares of you. The weapon does not automatically return to you, but you can retrieve it with the *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* Force Power (dealing an additional die of damage in the process, if the weapon is embedded in the target, as above).

#### **Greater Focused Force Talisman**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisites:* **Force Talisman**, **Focused Force Talisman**

As the **Focused Force Talisman** Talent, except that a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) spent to immediately recover the selected [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) does not count against the "one per turn" restriction on spending [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points).

#### **Primitive Block**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite: ***Empower Weapon**

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you may negate a melee attack by making a successful [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check. The DC of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check is equal to the result of the attack roll you wish to negate, and you take a cumulative -5 penalty on your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks to use this Talent for every time you have used **Primitive Block** since the beginning of your last turn.

You must have an **Empowered** **Weapon** drawn to use this Talent, and you must be aware of the attack and not [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed). You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to use this Talent to negate an attack against an adjacent character.

You may use the **Primitive Block** Talent to negate melee [Area Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks), such as those made by the [Whirlwind Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Whirlwind_Attack) feat. If you succeed on the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, you take half damage if the attack hit, and no damage if the attack missed.

## Homebrew Force Item Talents

#### **Force Artifact**
*Force Artifact Talent created by Wikia user LilLiteralist*

*Prerequisite:* Any one [Force Technique](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Technique)

There are certain items wielded by powerful Force users throughout history which become legends themselves. You can improve a Force-related object that you possess, such as a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), [Sith Talisman](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Talisman) or [Holocron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Holocron) to act as a focus for your Force abilities. (Your GM may also allow an item which is not yet Force-related, such as an ornate staff, to be used for this talent.) As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to attune the object and gain one of the following benefits, chosen when you attune the item:
- Gain a +2 Force bonus to [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks. For every [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) you spend, this bonus increases by +1 for the next [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check you make before the end of your turn.
- Gain +1d6 to Force powers and abilities that deal damage. For every [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) you spend, this bonus increases by +1d6 for the next [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check you make before the end of your turn which deals damage.
You must wear or wield the Force Artifact to gain this benefit. You can only have one Force Artifact at a time. The Force Artifact is attuned to you alone; others who wield the Force Artifact do not gain the bonus.

#### **Lasting Ichor Item**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Dathomir Field Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir_Field_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* *[Ichor Creation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ichor_Creation)*

Items you create through the *[Ichor Creation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ichor_Creation)* Force Power last for a number of days equal to your Character Level before dissipating. Instead, you can choose to spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) when creating the item to give it an indefinite duration.

#### **Superior Ichor Crafter**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Dathomir Field Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir_Field_Guide)*

*Prerequisites:* [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) 17, **Lasting Ichor Item*', *[Ichor Creation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ichor_Creation)*

Items you create through the *[Ichor Creation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ichor_Creation)* Force Power gain one applicable benefit as though enhanced by the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/superior-tech.md|Superior Tech]] feat.
