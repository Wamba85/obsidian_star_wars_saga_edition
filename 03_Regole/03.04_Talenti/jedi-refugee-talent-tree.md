*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

In [The Legacy Era](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legacy_Era), [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) are once again hunted to near-extinction. To survive, [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) must learn to conceal their [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) and blend in with the common galactic citizen.

#### **Cover Your Tracks**
You are adept at living beneath society's radar. Anyone who attempts to locate you using the [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) skill suffers a -5 penalty on their [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) checks.

#### **Difficult to Sense**
You are skilled at concealing your presence from other Force-users. You may reroll any opposed [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made to conceal your presence from someone who attempts to sense other Force-users, keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Force Veil **
*Prerequisite:* **Difficult to Sense**

Your ability to conceal yourself from other Force-users allows you to reduce the radius within which you can be detected to 10 kilometers (instead of 100 kilometers).

#### **Jedi Network**
You have access to a network of Jedi sympathizers. While in a civilized area, you can call upon this network of allies once per game session for one of the following purposes:
- *Acquire Equipment or Funds:* You can use your contacts to obtain material that might otherwise be [Licensed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Licensed), [Restricted](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Restricted), [Military](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Military), or [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal), provided the total value of the [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) does not exceed your [Jedi Knight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Knight) Level x 500 credits. Alternatively, you can obtain a number of credits from your contacts equal to this amount to spend as you see fit.
- *Obtain Information:* Your contacts provide you with information, automatically succeeding on a [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check (and covering the credit cost of the check) provided the DC does not exceed 20.
- *Receive Medical Attention:* Your contacts provide you and up to three of your allies with medical attention as dispensed by a skilled physician or healer. The length of the treatment cannot exceed 24 hours, but is otherwise free of charge and completely private.
- *Secure Safe House:* One of your contacts provides a safe redoubt for you and up to three of your allies, for a number of days equal to your [Jedi Knight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Knight) Class Level. While in hiding, you have no contact with anyone other than the individual who is hiding you. Once the allotted time is up, you must leave the Safe House or risk discovery. For each day you remain in hiding past this deadline, the Gamemaster should roll 1d20. On a result of 15 or higher, your Safe House is discovered, and your contact's complicity in keeping you hidden is exposed.
