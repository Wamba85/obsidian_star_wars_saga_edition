*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

Profiteers, gunrunners, and privateers can use the chaos of war to make a tidy profit, and you are no exception. Your Talents allow you to make the best of a bad situation, keep your pockets filled with credits, and keep you long enough to spend them.
#### **Advantageous Opening**
When an enemy or ally in your line of sight rolls a Natural 1 on an attack roll, you can make a melee or ranged attack against a single target within [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).
#### **Retribution**
When a target moves one of your allies in your line of sight down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by any means, you gain a +2 insight bonus to your attack rolls against that target until the end of your next turn.
#### **Slip By**
When you damage a target, until the beginning of your next turn, you can move through that target's space. Moving through the target's space might still provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity) as normal, and you must end your movement in a legal space.
#### **Thrive on Chaos**
*Prerequisite:* **Advantageous Opening**

When an enemy or ally within 20 squares of you is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you gain [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) equal to 5 + one-half your Character Level. Damage is subtracted from [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) first, and any [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) remaining at the end of the encounter go away. [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) do not stack.
#### **Vindication**
*Prerequisite:* **Retribution**

When an enemy you have damaged is reduced to 0 Hit Points or moved to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), your next attack made before the end of the encounter deals +1 die of damage.
