*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

Your skill with hand-to-hand combat is unmatched, and you can wield weapons with lethal accuracy and power.

#### **Accurate Blow**
Choose one [Exotic Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Melee)) or one of the following Weapon Groups in which you are proficient: [Advanced Melee Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapons), [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers), or [Simple Weapons (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapons_(Melee)). When you make a Melee Attack with a Weapon from the chosen group and the attack roll exceeds the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) by 5 or more, you deal +1 die of damage with the attack.

#### **Close-Quarters Fighter**
Whenever you occupy the same square as your target or are adjacent to your target, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your melee attack rolls against that target.

#### **Ignore Armor**
Once per encounter, when you make a melee attack, you can ignore any Armor or [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonuses granted by your target's Armor.

#### **Improved Stunning Strike**
*Prerequisite:* **[Stunning Strike](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stunning_Strike)**

When you damage an opponent with a melee attack that moves the target down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), the target cannot take any Action requiring a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) or a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) on its next turn.

#### **Whirling Death**
*Prerequisites:* **[Melee Smash](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Melee_Smash)**, **[Unrelenting Assault](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unrelenting_Assault)**

You twirl your Weapon around you in a blur, creating a circle of death around you. Any enemy target that begins its turn adjacent to you takes damage equal to your [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) bonus. You must be wielding a Melee Weapon to be using this Talent.
