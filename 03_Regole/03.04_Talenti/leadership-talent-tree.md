*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

A born leader, you know how to take charge and lead your companions and followers to success.

All of the Talents in this tree are [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effects. Moreover, you can't use any of these Talents on yourself.

#### **Born Leader**
Once per encounter, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you grant all allies within your line of sight a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls. This effect lasts for as long as they remain within line of sight of you. An ally loses this bonus immediately if line of sight is broken or you are unconscious or dead.

#### **Coordinate**
A [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) with this talent has a knack for getting people to work together. When you use this Talent as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), all allies within your line of sight grant an additional +1 bonus when they use the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action until the start of your next turn.

You may select this Talent multiple times; each time you do, the bonus granted by the coordinate ability increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5).

#### **Distant Command**
*Prerequisite: ***Born Leader**

Any ally who gains the benefit of your **Born Leader** Talent does not lose the benefit if their line of sight to you is broken.

#### **Fearless Leader**
*Prerequisite: ***Born Leader**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can provide a courageous example for your allies. For the remainder of the encounter, your allies receive a +5 morale bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against any Fear effect. Your allies lose this benefit if they lose line of sight to you, or you are killed or knocked unconscious.

#### **Rally**
*Prerequisites: ***Born Leader**,** Distant Command**

Once per encounter, you can rally your allies and bring them back from the edge of defeat. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), any allies within your line of sight who have less than half their total hit points remaining gain a +2 morale bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), and a +2 bonus to all damage rolls for the remainder of the encounter.

Unlike other [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Talents, **Rally** affects both allied [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) and characters with less than half their Hit Points. The [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) gains a +2 bonus to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), all crewmembers gain a +2 bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) so long as they are on board, and all [Gunners](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunners) gain a +2 bonus on damage with [Weapon Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems) (before multiplier, if any). Any crewmember who has less than half its Hit Points also gains the normal benefits of this Talent even if it leaves the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), but note that these bonuses do not stack.

#### **Trust**
*Prerequisites: ***Born Leader**,** Coordinate**

You can give up your [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to give one ally within your line of sight an extra [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) or [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) on their next turn, to do with as they please. The ally does not lose the Action if line of sight is later broken.
