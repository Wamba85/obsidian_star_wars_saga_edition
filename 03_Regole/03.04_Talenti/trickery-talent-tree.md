*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

[Charlatans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charlatan) are masters of misdirection, confusion, and trickery. They owe their success in double-cross to their uncanny knack for cultivating the existing beliefs of their marks and twisting them in subtle ways to their own benefit.

#### **Cunning Distraction**
When you successfully [Feint](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feint) an opponent in combat, you can immediately move up to one-half your speed.

#### **Damaging Deception **
*Prerequisite:* **Cunning Distraction**

You know how to distract a target, exposing weak spots that your allies can exploit. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of any target within your line of sight that can see, hear, and understand you. If successful, the next attack made by one of your allies made before the start of your next turn against that target deals 2 additional dice of damage.

#### **Distracting Shout**
*Prerequisite:* **Cunning Distraction**

Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to one of your allies being attacked, you can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check, replacing the [Defense Scores](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Scores) of that ally with the result of your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check for the resolution of that attack. If any [Defense Scores](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Scores) are higher than the [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check result, your ally can use that [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Score) instead. If the attack still hits, this does not count as the one use per encounter aspect of this Talent.

#### **Improved Soft Cover**
*Prerequisite:* **Innocuous**

While you occupy a square adjacent to another creature, you can use a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to gain a +2 [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the start of your next turn or until you are no longer adjacent to another creature, whichever comes first.

#### **Innocuous **
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check against a single enemy within 6 squares of you and in line of sight. If the check equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the target takes a -5 penalty on all attacks made against you until the start of your next turn.

#### **Treacherous **
*Prerequisites:* **Improved Soft Cover**, **Innocuous**

Whenever you are attacked in combat and adjacent to a creature other than your attacker, you can move 1 square as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). The attack, intended for you, instead targets the adjacent creature, though if you move away from a creature that [Threatens](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Threatens) you, it can make an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) before the original attack is resolved.
