*Reference Book:* *[Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

[Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrel) find ways to slip through fights of any size, even when the odds are against them.

#### **Cheap Shot**
*Prerequisite:* **Opportunistic Strike**

Once per encounter, you can make an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) against an opponent that takes the [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) Action to [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) from a space threatened by one of your allies within Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range).

#### **No Escape**
*Prerequisite:* **Opportunistic Strike**

Whenever an opponent uses the [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) Action to leave your [Threatened Area](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Threatened_Area), that opponent is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against you until the end of your next turn.

#### **Opportunistic Strike**
Once per encounter, you can make an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) against an opponent within Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) (even using a ranged weapon), if that opponent provokes an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) from one of your allies.

#### **Slippery Strike**
*Prerequisite:* **Strike and Run**

Once per encounter, you can designate an opponent you have just damaged as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction); that opponent cannot make [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity) against you until the end of your next turn.

You may use this in conjunction with the **Strike and Run** Talent, allowing you to benefit from both Talents as a single [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

#### **Strike and Run**
Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) after successfully damaging an opponent with a melee or ranged attack, you can [Move](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move) your Speed.
