*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

You have learned the alchemical arts of the ancient Sith Lords and can create objects and creatures that are filled with the power of [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side).

#### **Cause Mutation**
*Prerequisite:* **Sith Alchemy**

You can use your mastery of **Sith Alchemy** to create mutated abominations. You must have access to a willing (or unconscious) creature to which you will apply the [Sith Abomination Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Abomination_Template) or the [Chrysalis Beast Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Chrysalis_Beast_Template). You also need a medical lab outfitted for the process, which requires a number of days equal to creature's modified CL. You must spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) at the completion of the process to complete the transformation. A creature you have mutated is considered to be a domesticated creature, but for you only (unless it was already a domesticated creature before its mutation).

#### **Rapid Alchemy **
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can perform minor alchemical alterations to a Melee Weapon you wield. For the remainder of the encounter, you gain a +2 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on attack rolls with that Weapon. Additionally, once before the end of the encounter, you can sacrifice this bonus as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) to gain a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on a single damage roll you make with that Weapon.

#### **Sith Alchemy**
Your knowledge of **Sith Alchemy** allows you to imbue certain objects with the power of the [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side). You can perform any of the following Alchemical Transformations, though each time you do so, increase your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.
- *Create Sith Amulet:* You can create a [Sith Amulet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Amulet). The creation of a [Sith Amulet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Amulet) requires 25,000 credits' worth of gems and other raw materials, and the creation process takes 1 week (this work can be spread out over several sessions and need not be consecutive). At the end of the process, you must spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to complete the [Sith Amulet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Amulet), after which point it functions exactly as a [Sith Amulet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Amulet).
- *Create Sith Armor:* You can transform a suit of normal Battle Armor into the Dark Armor worn by [Sith Lords](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord). You must have a suit of Battle Armor to transform into the Dark Armor ([Light Battle Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Battle_Armor) becomes [Light Dark Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Dark_Armor), [Battle Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Armor) becomes [Dark Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Armor), and [Heavy Battle Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Battle_Armor) becomes [Heavy Dark Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Dark_Armor)). The transformation process takes 1 day for [Light Dark Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Dark_Armor), 2 days for [Dark Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Armor), and 3 days for [Heavy Dark Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heavy_Dark_Armor). You must spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) at the end of the creation process to complete the Armor's transformation.
- *Create Sith Talisman:* You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to imbue a portable object with the [Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side), creating a Sith Talisman that provides offensive strength to a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power). Creating the Sith Talisman takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). While you wear or carry the Sith Talisman on your person, you add 1d6 to your damage with [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers). You increase your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1 when you first wear or carry a Sith Talisman. You can have only one Sith Talisman active at any given time, and if it is destroyed, you cannot create another one for 24 hours.
- *Create Sith Weapon:* You can alchemically treat a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee)) or an [Advanced Melee Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Advanced_Melee_Weapon), turning it into a Sith Weapon. You must spend a Force Point and spend 1 hour imbuing the Weapon with the properties of a Sith Alchemical Weapon (*see also: [Sith Alchemical Weapon Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Alchemical_Weapon_Template)*). A [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) does not ignore the Sith Weapon's DR, and characters who are proficient in the Weapon's use can treat it as a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) for the purposes of the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)**, **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)**, and **[Redirect Shot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Redirect_Shot)** Talents (and any [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) that have these Talents as a prerequisite). Additionally, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), the wielder of a Sith Weapon can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to gain a bonus equal to their [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) to the damage of their next attack made with the Weapon before the end of the encounter. This increases the wielder's [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.

#### **Sith Alchemy Specialist**
*Prerequisite:* **Sith Alchemy**

You can modify an object with Sith Alchemy so that it gains a specific trait. Specific traits are listed in the Sith Alchemy Table, below. You can only perform one modification at a time. Unless otherwise noted, you cannot grant more than one benefit to a single object, and you cannot apply the same benefit more than once. You must spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) and devote 1 hour of uninterrupted work to apply a trait to the relevant object, and when you do so, you increase your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.
