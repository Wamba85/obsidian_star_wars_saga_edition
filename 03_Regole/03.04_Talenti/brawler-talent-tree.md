*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

You like to get "up close and personal" with your enemies and engage them in melee combat.

#### **Expert Grappler**
You gain a +2 competence bonus on [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) attacks.

#### **Gun Club**
You can use a ranged weapon as a melee weapon without taking a penalty on your attack roll. The weapon is otherwise treated as a [Club](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Club) in all respects.

If you are using a [Rifle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rifle) with a mounted [Bayonet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bayonet) or [Vibrobayonet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrobayonet), you may wield that weapon as a Double Weapon. The [Bayonet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bayonet) or [Vibrobayonet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vibrobayonet) end is treated normally, and the other end is treated as a [Club](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Club).

#### **Melee Smash**
You deal +1 point of damage with melee attacks.

#### **Stunning Strike**
*Prerequisite: ***Melee Smash**

When you damage an opponent with a melee attack, your opponents move an additional -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) if your damage roll result equals or exceeds the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold).

#### **Unbalance Opponent**
*Prerequisite: ***Expert Grappler**

You are skilled at keeping your opponents off balance in melee combat. At the beginning of your turn, you can choose to designate an opponent no more than one size category larger or smaller than you. That opponent doesn't get to add their [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) bonus on attack rolls when targeting you.

(If the opponent has a [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) penalty, they still suffer from that penalty.) The opponent's [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier applies to damage, as usual. You can select a new opponent on your next turn.
