The Imperial Inquisitors are a special group of Dark Jedi who work for the Empire. Trained to hunt down and destroy the remaining Jedi whenever they are found, Imperial Inquisitors are steeped in the lore of [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The Dark_Side). A character must be a member of [The Inquisitorius](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Inquisitorius) and have a [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) of 1+ to take Talents from this Talent Tree.

#### **Cower Enemies**
*Prerequisite:* **Force Interrogation**

When you use the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate), you can [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) all targets in a 6-Square [Cone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cone) (originating from your square) instead of [Intimidating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidating) a single target. All other limitations to the [Intimidation](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidation) use of the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill still apply.

#### **Force Interrogation**
When you deal damage to one or more creatures by using a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), you can immediately make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) a single target you damaged.

#### **Inquisition**
You are particularly adept at dealing with Force-sensitive foes. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and deal +1 die of damage against targets that have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat.

#### **Unsettling Presence**
*Prerequisite:* **Force Interrogation**

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to create an aura of unsettling discomfort around you. You make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check when you activate this Talent and compare the check result to the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of any creature that comes within 6 squares of you.

If your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check result equals or exceeds the creature's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that target takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) while within 6 squares of you. This aura lasts for the remainder of the encounter.
