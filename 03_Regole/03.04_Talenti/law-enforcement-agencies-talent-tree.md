*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Grand Army of the Republic (Part 2)*

Law Enforcement Agencies exist across the galaxy, some dating back thousands of years. Over time, many police units develop cultures, specialties and eccentricities unique to their jurisdictions. 
#### **Corellian Security Force**
*Prerequisite:* Must be a member of [CorSec](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/CorSec)

CorSec excels at tracking down suspects in urban environments. You may use [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) instead of [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) for the purposes of using the [Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Track) feature of [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival). If you are entitled to a [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival) reroll, you may reroll your [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations). 
#### **Journeyman Protector**
*Prerequisite:* Must be a member of [The Journeyman Protectors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Journeyman_Protectors)

Journeyman Protectors administer a kind of frontier justice. If the target of your [Targeted Suspect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeted_Suspect) ability has killed a sentient in your jurisdiction, your [Targeted Suspect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Targeted_Suspect) bonus also applies to damage on attacks made against that target. 
#### **Sector Ranger**
*Prerequisite:* Must be a member of [The Sector Rangers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sector_Rangers)

Sector Rangers often deputize locals to help navigate worlds that are new to them, or with some other specific knowledge they need for a case. You attract a loyal Deputy for the length of the pursuit of a single target (spanning multiple encounters, if necessary). You may only have one Deputy at a time, though a new one can be acquired upon the dismissal or death of an old one.

The Deputy is a [Nonheroic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nonheroic) character with a Class Level equal to three-quarters of your Character Level, rounded down. Your Deputy is entitled to an equal share of the total [Experience Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_Points) earned for an adventure. For example, a Deputy accompanies a party of five heroes on an adventure receives one-sixth of the XP that the group earns.
