The Force-using witches of the planet [Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir) are primitive yet powerful beings. They use ancient training handed down for generations as the basis of their powers. Only Force-users that are part of [The Witches of Dathomir](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witches_of_Dathomir) Force Tradition may select [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) from this tree.

#### **Adept Spellcaster**
You may use any [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that normally requires a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), or [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) instead. If you choose to do so, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to activate that power, but you must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.
#### **Charm Beast**
You may use a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check in place of a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check when attempting to change the [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of an undomesticated creature with an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) of 2 or less. Additionally, you do not take the normal -5 penalty on the check if the creature can't speak or understand your language.

This Talent is identical to the [Beastwarden Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charm_Beast_(Beastwarden)) of the same name, and both are considered to be the same Talent for the purposes of satisfying prerequisites.
#### **Command Beast**
*Prerequisite:* **Charm Beast**

Whenever you manage to shift the [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of a [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) to Indifferent or Friendly, you may treat that creature as a domesticated animal- but for you only (it remains undomesticated in its response to other creatures).

Additionally, you may use this [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) as a [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount), as per the [Ride](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ride) skill, provided that it is at least one size category larger than you and has a comfortable place for you to sit.
#### **Flight**
*Prerequisite:* **Adept Spellcaster**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to fly. You gain a fly speed equal to your base speed, and you can ascend at half speed or descend at double speed. The flight lasts until the start of your next turn; if you're still airborne at that time, you fall.
