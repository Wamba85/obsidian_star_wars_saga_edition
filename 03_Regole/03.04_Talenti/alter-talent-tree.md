[The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) grants you considerable power over your environment as well as others around you.

#### **Disciplined Strike**
Whenever you use a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that has an [Area Effect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Effect) (such as *[Force Slam](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Slam)*), you may exclude a certain number of targets from the effects of that power. The number of targets you may exclude in this manner is equal to your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (minimum of 1).

#### **Telekinetic Power**
Whenever you roll a natural 20 on your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to activate a Power with the [*[Telekinetic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telekinetic)*] descriptor, you may choose to use that [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) again immediately as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). You may direct the second use of the [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) against any eligible target.

#### **Telekinetic Savant**
Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you may return one [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Telekinetic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telekinetic)*] descriptor to your suite without spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). You may take this Talent multiple times. Each time you select it, you may use this Talent one additional time per encounter.

## Additional Alter Talents

#### **Aversion**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to radiate an invisible aura that makes other beings want to avoid you. Until the end of the encounter, all squares within 2 squares of you are considered [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) for your enemies. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Force Flow**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

For reasons unknown to you, [The Living Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Living_Force) flows through you in an irregular fashion. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, you gain one temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). If you do not spend this [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) before the end of the encounter, it is lost.

#### **Illusion**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* *[Mind Trick](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Trick)*

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to create an **Illusion** that seems perfectly real to anyone who views it. You designate the form and complexity of the **Illusion**, as well as its size and location, and make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check.

When a creature views the **Illusion**, compare the result of your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense); if your check result exceeds it's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), it believes the **Illusion** to be real. Any physical interaction with the **Illusion** (such as touching it, passing through it, or shooting it with a blaster) immediately reveals the true nature of the **Illusion**, and the creature is no longer deceived.

The **Illusion** lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Heroic Level.

The Illusion's size also affects your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, applying a penalty for exceptionally large **Illusions**. The penalties are -1 for Huge **Illusions**, -2 for Gargantuan **Illusions**, -5 for Colossal **Illusions**, and -10 for Colossal (Frigate) or larger **Illusions**. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Illusion Bond**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

*Prerequisite:* **Illusion**

Whenever you create an **Illusion** of a humanoid using the Illusion Talent, you are able to see and hear as though you were standing in the space occupied by your **Illusion**.

#### **Influence Savant**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can return one [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting)*] descriptor to your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) without spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select it, you can use it one additional time per encounter.

#### **Link**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

You can lend your strength in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to another character, creating a bond between you through which [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) flows. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can designate one willing ally within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight. This ally must be [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill.

As long as you remain within 12 squares of each other, you can aid each other on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). However, the character using the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) takes a -5 penalty on all Use the Force checks until the end of their next turn.

This **Link** lasts until the end of the encounter, or until you or your ally ends the **Link** (a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action)). You can have only one active **Link** at a time.

#### **Masquerade**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

*Prerequisite:* **Illusion**

You can use the **Illusion** Talent to create a disguise for yourself. You use the result of your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made to create the **Illusion** for the purposes of creating a [Deceptive Appearance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deceptive_Appearance), as per the application of the [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) Skill. All other rules and restrictions for using the **Illusion** Talent still apply.

#### **Move Massive Object**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisites:* **Telekinetic Power**, *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)*

*See also: [Move Object Reality Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object_Reality_Check)*

When you successfully use the *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* Force Power to move an object of Large size or bigger, you can make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with the object instead of throwing it at or dropping it on a single target, as normal for the Force Power. You must spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) when you activate the Force Power to do this, and the area you target is based on the size of the object: Large, 2x2; Huge, 3x3; Gargantuan, 4x4; Colossal and larger, 6x6.

When you use *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* to make an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) with the object you are moving, you compare your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of each creature, [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), and [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) in the target area. If your check equals or exceeds the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), it takes damage from the object (as determined by the *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* Force Power). Otherwise, the target takes half damage. This is an [Area Effect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Effect).

#### **Suppress Force**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

*Prerequisites:* **Influence Savant**, *[Mind Trick](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Trick)*

You can convince others that they have been cut off from [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), even if that is not the case, preventing them from making [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks. Whenever a target with an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) of 3 or higher within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight attempts to make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check for any reason, you can spend one use of the *[Mind Trick](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind_Trick)* Force Power as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

You make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, and if your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check equals or exceeds the target's [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check result, that target's [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) is negated, and the Action it was attempting fails.

#### **Telekinetic Prodigy**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* **Telekinetic Savant** 

When you take the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-training.md|Force Training]] Feat and select *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* as one of your [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers), you can also select one extra [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) to add to your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) for free. This extra [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) must contain the [*[Telekinetic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telekinetic)*] descriptor.

You can only gain one extra [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) each time you take the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-training.md|Force Training]] Feat, regardless of how many times you choose the *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* Force Power. If you increase your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) score at a later time and select the *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* power, you only gain an additional power if you did not take the *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)* power when you first chose that Feat. Otherwise, you gain an additional [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) as normal.

#### **Telepathic Influence**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* **Telepathic Link**

You naturally and unconsciously influence those who are regularly around you. Whenever you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, instead of regaining all your spent [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers), you may instead choose to grant one ally within 12 squares of you a temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point).

If your ally does not use this temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) before the end of the encounter, it is lost.

#### **Telepathic Link**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

You form an enhanced **Telepathic Link** with a willing ally, that possesses the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). The **Telepathic Link** is maintained until you choose to remove it (no Action required). As long as you remain within one kilometer of your target, you and the target can communicate telepathically as though you were speaking.

Once per encounter, you may use a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) from your target's [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) (if the target consents), or you may allow the target to use one of your [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers). You may only have one **Telepathic Link** active at a time.
## Homebrew Alter Talents

#### **Force Bond**
*Force Bond Talent created by TheSagaContinues user fairytalejedi.*

*Prerequisite:* **Telepathic Link**

A **Telepathic Link** becomes permanent between yourself and another possessing the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] Feat. While out of combat, you and the bonded individual can freely speak as if in the same location. By spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to make a DC 25 [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, you may give or take a single item of Diminutive size or smaller.

Alternatively, by spending a [Destiny Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Point), a bonded individual may make an attack roll against their partner, ignoring the effects of line of sight and line of effect (including [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) and [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment)). If the bonded individual dies, or you spend a [Destiny Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Point) to sever the bond, the **Force Bond** may be given to any other willing being possessing the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat.

#### **Force Prodigy**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

You have an extraordinarily strong connection to [The Living Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Living_Force). Whenever you roll a Natural 20 on a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, you gain one temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). If the [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) is not used by the end of the encounter, it is lost. You cannot take this Talent if you already possess the **Force Flow** Talent, and vice versa.

#### **Influence Natural**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Jedi Masters (Part 2)*

You possess a natural affinity for using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to influence others. Once per encounter, you may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) to place any [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting)*] descriptor into your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite), even if you do not normally have that Force Power. If the [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) is not used before the end of the encounter, it is lost. 

You may select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select it, you may use this Talent one additional time per encounter.

#### **Kinetic Might**

Once per round, you may choose to reroll a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made to activate one of the following [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers): *[Force Disarm](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Disarm)*, *[Force Grip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Grip)*, *[Force Slam](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Slam)*, *[Force Thrust](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Thrust)*, *[Move Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Object)*, or *[Repulse](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repulse)*. The result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.

#### **Telekinetic Natural**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - The Jedi Order*

You possess an innate talent with telekinetic manipulation, and uses of the ability come more naturally to you than it does to others. Once per encounter, you may expend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) to use any [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Telekinetic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telekinetic)*] descriptor, even if you do not normally have that Force Power in your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite).

#### **Transfer Force**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

*Prerequisite:* *[Vital Transfer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vital_Transfer)*

Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can expend one of your [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) to give one ally within line of sight a temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). If this [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) is not used by the end of the encounter, it is lost.
