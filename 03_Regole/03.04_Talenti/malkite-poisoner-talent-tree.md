*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Threats of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Threats_of_the_Galaxy)*

You have mastered the deadly arts of [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) from the masters on [Malkii](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Malkii). You can employ a wide array of lethal toxins with which you can quickly and efficiently destroy your targets.

#### **Malkite Techniques**
Once per encounter, you can apply a toxin to any non-Energy Slashing or Piercing weapon as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action). If an attack roll with that weapon also exceeds the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), that target is [Poisoned](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poisoned).

Each round on the creature's turn, the [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) makes an attack roll (1d20 + your Heroic Level) against the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense). If the attack succeeds, the target takes damage equal to 1d6 + one-half your Heroic Level and moves -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

A target moved to the end of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by the [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) is unconscious but continues to take damage as long as the [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) continues to attack. The [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) attacks each round until it misses, or until the victim is cured with a [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check (DC 10 + your Heroic Level).

#### **Modify Poison**
*Prerequisite:* **Malkite Techniques**

You can modify the deliver method of a [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) (Contact, Ingested, Inhaled) to another delivery method by succeeding in a [Knowledge (Life Science)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Science)) check (DC equal to the Poison's [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) DC). The Poison's capabilities and specific effects are unchanged.

#### **Numbing Poison**
*Prerequisite:* **Malkite Techniques**

Any target you [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) is automatically denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), for a long as it remains [Poisoned](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poisoned).

#### **Undetectable Poison**
*Prerequisite:* **Malkite Techniques**

The [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) DC needed to cure a [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) you have use against a target increases by 5.

#### **Vicious Poison**
*Prerequisite:* **Malkite Techniques**

Any [Poisons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poisons) you have used against a target gain a +2 bonus to their attack rolls made against that target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense).
