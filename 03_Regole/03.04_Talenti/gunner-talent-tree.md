While your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) is engaged in a [Dogfight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dogfight), you take no penalty on your attack rolls with [Vehicle Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapons), even if you are not the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)).

#### **Expert Gunner**
You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls made using [Vehicle Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapons).

#### **Quick Trigger**
*Prerequisite:* **Expert Gunner**

Whenever an enemy [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) moves out of your square, or an adjacent square, you may make a single attack against that [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) as an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity).

#### **System Hit**
*Prerequisite:* **Expert Gunner**

Whenever you deal damage to a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) that equals or exceeds its [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), you move that [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) an additional -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

## Additional Gunner Talents

#### **Crippling Hit**

*Prerequisites:* **Expert Gunner**, **System Hit**

Whenever you make an attack that causes a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) to move -1 or more steps down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), you may also cause it to lose one of the following systems: [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive), one [Weapon System](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_System) or [Weapon Battery](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Battery), or communications.

The system remains inoperable until the target regains all steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

When firing a [Vehicle Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapon), you treat the distance to the target as though it were one [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) category less than it actually is. For example, when targeting an opponent at Short Range, you treat it as though it were at least Point-Blank Range for the purpose of determining bonuses or penalties.
