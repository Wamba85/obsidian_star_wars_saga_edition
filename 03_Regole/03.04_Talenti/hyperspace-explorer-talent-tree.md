*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

You are an experienced deep-space explorer who has learned a few tricks along the way that help you survive both in space, and planet-side.

#### **Deep-Space Gambit**
Once per encounter, when you or a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) you occupy are the target of an attack roll, you can force your opponent to reroll the attack. The opponent must keep the worse of the two results.

#### **Guidance**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception)

You know how to guide others through treacherous terrain. You may use a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to point out the path of least resistance to an ally within line of sight who can see, hear, and understand you. The ally ignores the effect of [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) on its next turn. You cannot use this Talent on yourself.

#### **Hidden Attacker**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth)

Your shots seem to come from nowhere. Whenever you use the [Snipe](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Snipe) application of the [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) skill, you do so as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) instead of a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

#### **Hyperspace Savant**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot)

You can substitute your [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) skill for the [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check made to [Astrogate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Astrogate), or [Use Sensors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Sensors) while you are the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) of a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle).

#### **Vehicle Sneak**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot)

You know how to fly and operate your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) in order to hide its approach visually, decrease the noise it produces, and minimize its sensor signature. Treat your ship as two size categories smaller when attempting [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks.

## Additional Hyperspace Explorer Talents

#### **Silent Movement**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth)

You know how to move silently in almost any environment. You never suffer from unfavorable circumstances from environmental effects associated with noise when you [Sneak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak) using the [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) skill. Once per round, when you make a [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check, you can automatically use the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action on one ally's [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check.

## Homebrew Hyperspace Explorer Talents

#### **Hyperdrive Tinkerer**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

If you fail a [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check to [Astrogate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Astrogate), and the rerolled check results in a damaged ship, you may make a DC 20 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check in order to repair the [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) immediately and arrive normally at the plotted destination.

If this check fails, the [Hyperdrive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) becomes disabled and the ship immediately drops from Hyperspace.

#### **Hyperlane Mastery**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

Select a major route through the galaxy. When making a [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check to [Astrogate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Astrogate) within that region, the DC is reduced by 5. In addition, you may [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on the check, even if conditions would not normally allow it. If this check fails, you immediately know and may attempt to try again.

You may select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select this Talent, it applies to a different route through the galaxy.

#### **Regional Expertise**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [New Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/New_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

Select a particular region of space, not including [Wild Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wild_Space). When making a [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check to [Astrogate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Astrogate) within that region, the DC is reduced by 5. In addition, you may [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on the check, even if conditions would not normally allow it. If this check fails, you immediately know and may attempt to try again.

You may select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select this Talent, it applies to a different region of space.
