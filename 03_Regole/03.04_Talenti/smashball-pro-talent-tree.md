*Smashball Pro Talent Tree content created by Wikia user TheMightyWagon.*

Although combat sports are dominant in galactic culture, there's still a massive audience for other kinds of displays of athleticism, especially the contact sport of smashball. Your time rising up from the amateur circuits to the professional leagues have made you uniquely suited for great displays of raw physicality.
#### **Practiced Cardio**
*Prerequisite: *[Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Endurance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance)

You might not be the best player, but you've taken practice seriously, and you incredible endurance proves it. You may choose to reroll any [Endurance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance) check for [Forced March](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Forced_March), to continue [Running](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Run_(Endurance)), or to [Swim/Tread Water](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swim/Tread_Water), keeping the better of the two results.
#### **Smashball Pass**
Playing passback in smashball taught you the importance of making good throws under pressure. When using a [Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown_Weapon), you can [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) with a single [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) instead of two. Additionally, you can benefit from [Aiming](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aiming) with a [Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown_Weapon) even if the weapon makes an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack). When using this [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents), you do not gain the benefits of the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/deadeye.md|Deadeye]] [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) if the [Thrown Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ranged_Weapons) is making an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks).
#### **Perfect Spiral**
*Prerequisite: ***Smashball Pass**

You've mastered the art of making it easy for a catchback to receive your passes, regardless of their skill or distance. If you've [Aimed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aimed) with a [Thrown](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown) weapon or object, you reduce the [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) by one category for the purposes of that attack roll (for example, from Medium to Short Range). Additionally, if an ally has [Readied an Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Readied_an_Action) to receive a [Thrown](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Thrown) weapon or object from you, you can throw it to them as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), provided you [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) and the weapon or object is at least one size category smaller than you. This throw is automatically successful. At GM discretion, some objects may not be aerodynamic enough to work with this ability.
#### **Linebreaker Charge**
As a linebreaker, you're expected to charge forth and break down the defenses of the opponents to create openings for your fellow players to score. When using the [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) Action, you can move up to double your [Speed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Speed).
#### **Centerbreaker Charge**
*Prerequisites: ***Linebreaker Charge**, [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/bantha-rush.md|Bantha Rush]]

Having to protect the passback, the centerbreaker has to leverage their strength to an even greater degree than the linebreakers to keep the defenders at bay. When using the [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) Action, you can move with your opponent while using the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/bantha-rush.md|Bantha Rush]] feat. If you have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/improved-bantha-rush.md|Improved Bantha Rush]] feat, you can move with them as many squares as you push them back.

**Suktub Defender**

*Prerequisites:* **Centerbreaker Charge**, [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/improved-bantha-rush.md|Improved Bantha Rush]]

You are a legendary linebreaker in the smashball arena, your skill on either side worthy of the Suktub Trophy. You can do each of the following abilities once per encounter:

- Make a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack. The distance you push a target with [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/improved-bantha-rush.md|Improved Bantha Rush]] is a number of squares equal to your [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) modifier.
- Make a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack. You can make [Acrobatics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Acrobatics) checks to [Tumble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tumble) through [Threatened Areas](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Threatened_Areas) or an enemy's [Fighting Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Space) when you [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge). This does not count as [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain); however, the DC to Tumble increases by 2 for each additional [Threatened Area](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Threatened_Area) or enemy's [Fighting Space](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fighting_Space) you [Tumble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tumble) through.
- Make a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack. At the end of the [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge), if you succeed on a [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) or [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) check, the defender may not attempt to escape the [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) or [Grapple](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grapple) until after the end of your next turn.
