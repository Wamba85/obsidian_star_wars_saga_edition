*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

Your skills at observation and stealth are frequently called upon as you gather information about enemy forces.

#### **Forward Patrol**
*Prerequisite:* **Watchful Step**

At the start of a [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round) in which you are not caught by [Surprise](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise), you can designate one ally within 6 squares of you as able to retain his or her [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) during the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round).

#### **Mobile Combatant**
*Prerequisites:* **Forward Patrol**, **Watchful Step**

You know that the key to winning a fight is keeping your enemies from pinning you down. You can use each of the following Actions once per encounter:
- *Evasive Assault:* As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a single melee or ranged attack. If the attack successfully deals damage, you gain a +5 dodge bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the end of your next turn.
- *Expeditious Attack:* As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a single melee or ranged attack, then move up to half your Speed as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
- *Yielding Assault:* When you are damaged by an enemy's melee or ranged attack, you can move up to one-half your Speed as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). This movement does not provoke an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity). On your next turn, you gain a favorable circumstance (+2 bonus) to your first attack roll against the same enemy that damaged you.

#### **Trailblazer**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Survival](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Survival)
	
During your turn, you can spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to allow all allies within 6 square of you and within your line of sight to count the first square of [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain) as normal terrain each time they move.

#### **Watchful Step**
You can use your [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check modifier instead of your [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) modifier when making [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) checks. If you are entitled to an [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check reroll, you can reroll your [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations). You are considered to be [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative).
