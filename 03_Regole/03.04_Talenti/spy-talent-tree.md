*Reference Book:* *[Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

[Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) are often capable of getting into areas unseen, and they make excellent spies thanks to their survival instincts and aptitude for stealth.

#### **Blend In**
You know the tricks of body language and movement that allow you to disguise your appearance without elaborate materials or efforts.

You can use your [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) modifier in place of your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) modifier for the purpose of creating a [Deceptive Appearance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deceptive_Appearance). You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) skill for the purpose of using this Talent. If you are entitled to a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check reroll, you can reroll your [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and conditions).

#### **Incognito**
*Prerequisite:* **Blend In**

Spies are adept at concealing their identities, even if not using a physical disguise. You can reroll any [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check for the purpose of creating a [Deceptive Appearance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deceptive_Appearance), keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Improved Surveillance**
*Prerequisites:* **Surveillance**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception)

When you successfully use the **Surveillance** Talent, you grant yourself and your allies a +1 insight bonus to all [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) against the target.

#### **Intimate Knowledge**
*Prerequisite:* **Surveillance**

Experienced spies and [Scouts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) remember many details from previous assignments, providing insights on later missions. Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20) on a check involving a [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in, or [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) on a check involving a [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill you are [Untrained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Untrained) in, even if circumstances would not normally allow you to [Take 10](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_10) or [Take 20](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Take_20).

#### **Surveillance**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception)

As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can make a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check against a single target within line of sight. The DC is equal to 15 or the target's [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check result (if the target is actively trying to remain hidden), whichever is greater.

If the check is successful, you grant yourself and all allies within line of sight a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls against that target until the end of your next turn. Your allies must be able to hear and understand you to benefit from this bonus, and they do not lose the benefit if they move out of line of sight after it is used.

#### **Traceless Tampering**
Spies specialize in leaving no evidence of their presence when they tamper with advanced electronics or basic mechanical systems. When using [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) to [Disable Device](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disable_Device), you automatically leave no trace when tampering (with no DC increase), and you must fail by 10 or more (instead of 5 or more) before something goes wrong.
