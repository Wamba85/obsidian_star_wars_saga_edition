*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You have mastered the ability to make something out of nothing, turning spare parts and scrap into a [Sensor Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sensor_Pack), a Weapon, or a protective suit of Armor. You can build what you need on the fly, and sometimes your customized gear proves more useful than what you otherwise might have purchased.

#### **Bigger Bang**
*Prerequisite:* **Improvised Device**

Whenever you create a [Grenade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade) with the **Improvised Device** Talent, the [Grenade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade) deals an additional die of damage when used. 

#### **Capture Droid**
Once per encounter, you can use this Talent on an adjacent enemy [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) that has been reduced to 0 Hit Points or moved to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), but not destroyed.

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check against the Droid's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If your result equals or exceeds the Droid's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) moves +2 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), regains 1d8 Hit Points, becomes your ally, and it's [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) toward you immediately shifts to [Friendly](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Friendly).

The [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) fights on your side until the end of the encounter, at which point it is destroyed.

#### **Custom Model**
*Prerequisites:* **Improvised Device**, [Tech Specialist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_Specialist)

Whenever you create a device with the **Improvised Device** Talent, you can apply one modification granted by the [Tech Specialist](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tech_Specialist) Feat to the device. This customization does not affect the value of the item being created.

#### **Improved Jury-Rig**
You can use the [Jury-Rig](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jury-Rig) application of the [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) Skill as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) instead of as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). Additionally, you are not required to make a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) to successfully [Jury-Rig](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jury-Rig) a device or [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), and the device or [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) moves +3 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) instead of +2.

#### **Improvised Device**
You can create a temporary piece of almost any type of [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) from the spare parts you have around. To do so, you must make a DC 25 [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check and spend one hour building the device. The object can have a maximum value of 200 credits x your Class Level, it cannot have an availability of [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare) or [Illegal](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Illegal), and it cannot be unique.

The device you create must be something that you would be reasonably familiar with, and after 24 hours the object is destroyed. You can use this Talent once per day.
