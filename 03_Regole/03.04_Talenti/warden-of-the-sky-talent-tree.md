Wardens of the Sky use a combination of martial arts and [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) to help keep the space lanes safe. As a Warden of the Sky, you rely on nothing more than your own body to serve as a weapon against predators. You must be a member of [The Wardens of the Sky](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wardens_of_the_Sky) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Brutal Unarmed Strike**
*Prerequisite:* **Telekinetic Strike**

Whenever you roll the damage for an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, you reroll any dice that come up with a result of 1.

#### **Martial Resurgence**
You recover all spent [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers), adding them to your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) again, whenever you roll a Natural 20 on an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack.

#### **Rebound Leap**
Whenever you reduce an opponent to 0 Hit Points with an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, you can make a [Jump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jump) check as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), moving a distance as determined by the results of your [Jump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jump) check. You can use the *[Surge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surge)* Force Power as normal to enhance this [Jump](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jump) check, increasing the distance you move.

#### **Simultaneous Strike**
*Prerequisite:* [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make two [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attacks, each against different targets.

#### **Telekinetic Strike**
Whenever you make a successful [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, you can add the result of a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) roll to the damage roll instead of the attack roll.

#### **Telekinetic Throw**
*Prerequisite:* [Throw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Throw)

Whenever you successfully use the [Throw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Throw) feat, your opponent falls [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) in any space you desire up to 3 squares beyond your reach.
