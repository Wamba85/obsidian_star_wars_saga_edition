At every odd-numbered level (1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on), a [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) gains an additional [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). A [Noble](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Noble) may choose a [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) from any of the following Talent Trees (Noble) they wish, but they must meet the prerequisites (if any) of the chosen [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent). No [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) can be selected more than once unless expressly indicated.
