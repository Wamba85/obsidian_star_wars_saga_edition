*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

The [Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) that follow the path of the Sentinel are the true enemies of [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side), hunting down evil and stopping the spread of darkness wherever they go. You are a master of subtlety and difficult to tempt with [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side), even when constantly confronted by its power.

#### **Clear Mind**
You may reroll any opposed [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made to oppose [Sense Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Force) checks. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

#### **Dark Side Sense**
[Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi) following the path of the Sentinel become exceptionally talented at rooting out evil. You may reroll any [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made to sense the presence and relative location of characters with a [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) of 1 or higher. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

#### **Dark Side Scourge**
*Prerequisite:* **Dark Side Sense**

Against creatures with a [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) of 1 or higher, you deal extra damage on melee attacks equal to your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) bonus (minimum +1).

#### **Force Haze**
*Prerequisite:* **Clear Mind**

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to create a "Haze" that hides you and your allies from the perception of others. You can hide a number of creatures in line of sight equal to your Class Level. Make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check and compare the result to the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of any opponent that moves into line of sight of any creature hidden by your **Force Haze**. If your check result equals or exceeds the opponent's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), all hidden creatures are treated as if they had [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment) against the opponent.

The **Force Haze** lasts for up to 1 minute but is dismissed instantly if anyone hidden by the **Force Haze** makes an attack.

You may use this Talent to hide a single [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) while you are on board. The [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) can't have a size penalty to [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative), or [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) checks greater than your Heroic Level. Thus, a Gargantuan Starship (size penalty of -5) can be hidden only by a character of 5th level or higher.

#### **Resist the Dark Side**
*Prerequisite:* **Dark Side Sense**

You gain a +5 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to all [Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense) scores against [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) with the [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] descriptor, and [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) originating from any dark Force-user (that is, any Force-use whose [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) equals their [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) score).

When you interact with another sentient creature, you can use a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to reduce the impression you leave on it.

A target that is higher in level than you gains a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) to resist this ability. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Sentinel Strike**

Any time you attack a [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) opponent (or one who is denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against you) with a damage-dealing [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), or attack with a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), you deal an extra +1d6 points of damage with that attack.
