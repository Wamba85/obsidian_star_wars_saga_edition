*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

Mercenaries are blasters-for-hire who sell their services to the highest bidder. Though money might motivate them, few types of soldiers are more capable of operating independably.

Talents from this Talent Tree can be used to qualify for the [Elite Trooper](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Trooper) Prestige Class, in addition to those listed in the *Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*.

#### **Commanding Presence**
Once per encounter, you can activate this Talent as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). Until the end of the encounter, all your opponents within 6 squares of you take a -2 penalty to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Fear effect.

Additionally, [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) is now considered a Class Skill for you.

#### **Dirty Fighting**
Once per encounter, if you successfully damage an opponent with a melee or ranged attack, you reduce the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) by 2 points for the remainder of the encounter.

#### **Feared Warrior**
*Prerequisite:* **Commanding Presence**

Your abilities on the battlefield are well known and feared. When you reduce an opponent to 0 Hit Points with an attack, you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) against all targets within 6 squares. If your [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that target takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls for the remainder of the encounter.

This Talent affects any given target only once per encounter. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Fear effect.

#### **Focused Warrior**
Your training makes you confident and disciplined in combat. When you successfully deal damage to an opponent in combat, you gain a +5 morale bonus to [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) until the start of your next turn. You lose this bonus to [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) if you are [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised) or [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) for any reason.

#### **Ruthless**
*Prerequisite:* **Dirty Fighting**

When you deal damage to a target with a melee or ranged attack roll that exceeds the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls against that target for the remainder of the encounter.

#### **Mercenary's Grit**
