*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue)*

You use your knowledge of stealth and survival to make yourself a master of espionage and a valuable resource for those who wish to keep their hands clean in dirty situations.

#### **Fade Out**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth)

You know how to make yourself scarce when dealing with suspicious or hostile beings. You can use your [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) skill, not [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception), to [Create a Diversion to Hide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception#Create%20a%20Diversion%20to%20Hide). If you are [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) skill, you gain a +5 bonus to your skill check for the purpose to [Create a Diversion to Hide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception#Create%20a%20Diversion%20to%20Hide).

#### **Keep Together**
Whenever you are hit or missed by a melee or ranged attack, you can move up to your speed as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), provided that you end your movement adjacent to an ally. This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).

#### **Prudent Escape**
Whenever you reduce a target to 0 Hit Points or otherwise render a creature unconscious, you can choose two allies within 6 squares of you and within your line of sight. You and the allies you chose can immediately move up to their Speeds as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).

#### **Reactive Stealth**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth)

When you are missed by a ranged attack and have [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) or [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from the attacker, you can move up to half your Speed as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) and make a [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check to become hidden from your attacker, provided you still have [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) or [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) at the end of your movement.

#### **Sizing Up**
Once per encounter, you can make a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of a single target that is within 6 squares of you and within your line of sight. If you succeed, you gain a +2 insight bonus to all [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) and attack rolls against the target until the end of the encounter.
