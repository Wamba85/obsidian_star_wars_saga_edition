*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

As an [Outlaw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Outlaw), you live under a shadow, and everywhere you go, any time you reveal yourself, you risk being noticed and captured. As a result, you develop a number of abilities that help you escape pursuers, even when hopelessly outnumbered.

#### **Confounding Attack**
*Prerequisites:* **Tangle Up**, **Uncanny Instincts**

Once per encounter, whenever you would use **Uncanny Instincts**, you can forgo the movement to make an immediate melee or ranged attack against the opponent that hit you. If your attack is a melee attack that hits and deals damage, you and your opponent immediately switch places; assuming both you and your opponent can end in a legal space.

#### **Double Up**
*Prerequisites:* **Find an Opening**, **Seize the Moment**

Once per encounter, whenever you would use **Seize the Moment**, you can forgo the extra [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to make an immediate melee or ranged attack against the damaged opponent. If your attack is a ranged attack that hits and deals damage, you treat the damage dealt by you and your ally as though it was one attack for purposes of overcoming [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction), [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating), and determining whether the damage exceeded the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold). 

#### **Find an Opening **
*Prerequisite:* **Seize the Moment**

Whenever you would use **Seize the Moment**, you can forgo the [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to be able to [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) as a single [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) on your turn.

#### **Opportunistic Defense**
*Prerequisite:* **Uncanny Instincts**

Once per encounter, whenever you would use **Uncanny Instincts**, you can forgo this extra movement and instead increase your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) by 5 until the end of your next turn.

#### **Preternatural Senses**
Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can add one-half your Class Level to the [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Score) of your choice.

#### **Seize the Moment**
Once per round, whenever an ally successfully damages an opponent, you can take a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

#### **Tangle Up**
*Prerequisite:* **Uncanny Instincts**

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a non-[Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) melee or ranged attack against an opponent within [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). If the attack hits, you deal half your normal damage (minimum 1 point), but your opponent loses its next [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

#### **Uncanny Instincts **
Once per round whenever an opponent successfully deals damage to you, you can move 1 square as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
