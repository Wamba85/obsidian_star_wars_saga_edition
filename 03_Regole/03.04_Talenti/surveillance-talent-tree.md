*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

You have mastered the art of surveillance, transforming the information you gather with scouting into a distinct advantage on the battlefield.

#### **Advanced Intel**
*Prerequisite:* **Spotter**

If you are not [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised) at the beginning of combat, you can use the **Spotter** talent as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) on your first turn, including during the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round).

#### **Hidden Eyes**
If you have [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) from a target, you gain a +5 circumstance bonus on all [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks made against that target.

#### **Hunt the Hunter**
When you use a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to actively look for hidden enemies, you can make a single melee or ranged attack against any one enemy you notice with your [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check.

#### **Seek and Destroy**
*Prerequisite:* **Hidden Eyes**

If you make a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack against a target that is unaware of you, that target cannot make a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check to notice you until after the attack is resolved, even if you move away from [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) or [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment).

#### **Spotter**
As a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action), you can make a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check with a DC equal to 10 + the CL of a single target enemy in your line of sight. If you succeed on the check, you and all your allies that can hear and understand you gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls against that target until the end of your next turn.
