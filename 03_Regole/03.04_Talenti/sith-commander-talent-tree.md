*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

[The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith) use terror to lead their troops, and Sith commanders have few compunctions about making examples of underlings. Therefore, it is not surprising that [The Sith](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sith) use anger and fear of their subordinates to their own terrible advantage.

#### **Desperate Measures**
*Prerequisite:* **Focus Terror**

Desperation stems from fear. Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can instill desperation in all allies within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight, allowing each of them to make an immediate attack at a -5 penalty.

#### **Focus Terror **
Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can harness the fear felt by your allies and transform it into a powerful motivational tool. All allies within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight move +2 steps along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), but suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls and [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) for a number of rounds equal to your Character Level.

#### **Incite Rage**
Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can channel your anger and hatred into your allies. All allies within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight gain a +1 rage bonus on attack rolls, but take a -2 penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). This effect lasts until the encounter ends, or until you are knocked unconscious or killed.

#### **Power of Hatred**
*Prerequisite:* **Incite Rage**

Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can inflame the passions of your allies. Each ally within your line of sight who has fewer than half its normal Hit Points gains bonus Hit Points equal to your Character Level. Damage is subtracted from the bonus Hit Points first, and any bonus Hit Points remaining at the end of the encounter go away. Bonus Hit Points from multiple sources do not stack.
