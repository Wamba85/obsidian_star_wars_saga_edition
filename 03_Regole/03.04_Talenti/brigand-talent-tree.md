*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

You use your experience operating on the wrong side of the law to give you an advantage in a fight, fair or otherwise.

#### **Cheap Trick**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception)

When you make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check to [Feint](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feint) against an enemy within 6 squares of you, you can roll twice, keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Easy Prey**
*Prerequisite:* **Cheap Trick**

When you make an attack as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) and successfully hit an enemy, you can choose to reduce the damage you deal by half. That target is then denied its [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonus to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against your attacks until the end of your next turn.

#### **Quick Strike**
*Prerequisite:* **Cheap Trick**

During the initial round of combat, if you successfully damage an enemy who has not yet acted in the combat, you can make an immediate attack as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) against a different target within 6 squares of the first target.

#### **Sly Combatant**
*Prerequisites:* **Cheap Trick**, **Easy Prey**

You quickly move about the battlefield, taking advantage of the chaos of battle. You can use each of the following Actions once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action):
- *Distracting Injury*: Make a single melee or ranged attack against any enemy within your range. If the attack successfully hits, that enemy takes a -2 penalty to his or her attack rolls and damage rolls until the end of the encounter.
- *Make Them Bleed*: Make a single melee or ranged attack against any living creature within your range. If you successfully deal damage as a result of the attack, that enemy gains a [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) that can be removed only with a successful DC 25 [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check to perform [Surgery](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surgery).
- *Strength in Numbers*: Make a single melee or ranged attack against an enemy who is adjacent to one or more of your allies. If you successfully hit that enemy, you gain a +2 bonus to damage for each ally that is adjacent to the target.
