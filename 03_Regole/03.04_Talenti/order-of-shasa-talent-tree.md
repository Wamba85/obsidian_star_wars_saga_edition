*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

[The Order of Shasa](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_Shasa) is still developing training techniques and abilities, taking most of their influence from Manaan's oceans. You must be a member of [The Order of Shasa](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_Shasa) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described here.
#### **Deception Awareness**
Realizing how devastating the consequences would have been if the Sith had successfully deceived her and her companions during the Jedi Civil War, Shasa has developed a technique for using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to detect deceptions. You gain +5 to your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) against uses of the [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) skill.

Additionally, you can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead of a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check to [Sense Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Deception) and [Sense Influence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Influence). You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) for the purposes of using this Talent. If you are entitled to a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).
#### **Greater Weapon Focus (Fira)**
*Prerequisite:* [Weapon Focus (Fira)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Fira))

You have mastered the chosen weapon of [The Order of Shasa](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Order_of_Shasa). You gain a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls with a [Fira](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fira). This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by the [Weapon Focus (Fira)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Fira)) feat.
#### **Progenitor's Call**
You have learned to sense the call of your ancestors and wield it through [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Once per encounter, you can telepathically disrupt an opponent by making a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check against the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If you succeed, the target is confused by the call, moving -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) and losing its [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) on its next turn.

A creature can only be affected by this power once per encounter, and the [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) can be removed with a DC 15 [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check or by resting for 8 hours. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
#### **Waveform**
Taking cues from Manaan's oceans, you know how to emulate wave action using [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), when you use a [Telekinetic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telekinetic) Force Power (that is, a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Telekinetic](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telekinetic)*] descriptor), you manipulate the particles of the environment around you to add to the force of the impact, allowing you to add your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier to any damage dealt (minimum +1).
## Homebrew Order of Shasa Talents

#### **Fira Mastery**
*Fira Mastery Talent created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formally Wikia user Lukewarner).*

You treat a [Fira](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fira) as a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee)) instead of as an [Exotic Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Melee)). Additionally, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with a [Fira](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fira). This Talent counts as the [Weapon Focus (Fira)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Fira)) feat for the purpose of satisfying prerequisites.

If you also have the [Weapon Focus (Simple Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Simple_Weapons)) feat, the attack bonus provided by this Talent does not stack with the attack bonus provided by [Weapon Focus (Simple Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Simple_Weapons)).
