You are an expert at small-unit tactics, leading a small group of allies into battle as a cohesive unit.

All Talents in the Squad Leader Talent Tree apply to other characters in a Squad you command. A Squad includes yourself plus a number of characters equal to or less than the sum of your [Elite Trooper](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Trooper) Class Level plus your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier (minimum of one other character). These characters must be on foot, must have line of sight to you, and must be able to communicate with you to gain the benefit of your Squad Leader Talents. As a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), you designate which characters are in your Squad at the beginning of your first turn.

Each Squad can benefit from the Talents of only a single Squad Leader, designated when an encounter begins. A character without a Squad Leader can join an existing Squad if both character and Squad Leader are willing and if the Squad Leader has not reached his or her maximum Squad size.
