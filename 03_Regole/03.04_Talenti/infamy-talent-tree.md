*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

You are wanted in multiple systems for criminal acts, and your manner of doing business has earned you an unsavory reputation in the criminal underworld.

#### **Inspire Fear I**
Your infamy and reputation are such that any opponent whose level is equal to or less than your Character Level takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and opposed [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) made against you, as well as [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks made to activate [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) against you. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) [Fear](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fear) effect.

#### **Inspire Fear II**
*Prerequisite:* **Inspire Fear I**

As **Inspire Fear I**, except that the penalty increases to -2.

#### **Inspire Fear III**
*Prerequisites:* **Inspire Fear I**, **Inspire Fear II**

As **Inspire Fear I**, except that the penalty increases to -5.

#### **Notorious**
Your reputation as a [Crime Lord](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Crime_Lord) is known throughout the galaxy, even on fringe worlds. When you are not [Disguised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disguised), you may reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate), keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Shared Notoriety**
*Prerequisite:* **Notorious**

When your [Minions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Minions) invoke your name, others take note. If you have [Minions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Minions), they may reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to intimidate others, but the result of the reroll must be accepted, even if it is worse.

## Additional Infamy Talents

#### **Fear Me**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

*Prerequisites:* **[Attract Minion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attract_Minion)**, **Inspire Fear I**, **Inspire Fear II**

Such is the fear you instill in your minions that when in your presence, they would rather die than disappoint you. Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to one of your minions being moved down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), you can reduce the number of steps the minion moves down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by 1. Additionally, the target regains Hit Points equal to your Heroic Level. If the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points or moved to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), you cannot use this Talent on that target.

#### **Frighten**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

*Prerequisites:* **[Attract Minion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attract_Minion)**, **Inspire Fear I**

Once per encounter, you can designate a minion as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) to spread fear among your enemies. At any point before the end of the encounter, you can activate this ability to force all enemies adjacent to your minion to move 1 square away from the minion. This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity). This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Master Manipulator**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

*Prerequisites:* **Notorious**, [Skill Focus (Persuasion)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Persuasion))

When you make a successful [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check, you can immediately make a second [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the same target, even if it is not normally allowed. The second [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check need not be for the same use of the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) skill as the first. For example, if you successfully [Change Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Change_Attitude) of the target, you can immediately attempt to [Change Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Change_Attitude) a second time, or you can attempt to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate) the target instead.

#### **Small Favor**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

*Prerequisites:* **Notorious**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion)

You can call in a small favor from someone who owes you. Once per day, make a DC 25 [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check. If the check is successful, an informant gives you information, granting you a +10 competence bonus to one [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) or [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) check made within the next 24 hours.

#### **Terrify**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

*Prerequisites:* **Frighten**, **Inspire Fear I**, **Inspire Fear II**

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against a target that is within your line of sight and that is also affected by your **Inspire Fear** Talent. If you equal or exceed the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), then on its next turn the target must spend at least one [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) to move away from you. If the target is somehow prevented from doing so, then the penalty from the **Inspire Fear** Talent doubles until the start of your next turn. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Fear effect.

#### **Unsavory Reputation**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

*Prerequisites:* **Inspire Fear I**, **Inspire Fear II**, **Inspire Fear III**, **Notorious**

Any opponent that is reduced to half Hit Points or fewer while within 6 squares of you takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) for the duration of the encounter. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Fear effect.
