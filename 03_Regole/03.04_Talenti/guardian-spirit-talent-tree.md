*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

You have a spirit watching over you, providing advice and continuing your training in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Although [Force Spirits](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Spirits) cannot physically aid you, their guidance is critical to your success.

#### **Crucial Advice**
Once per encounter, when you fail a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check), you can reroll the [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) with a +2 circumstance bonus. (In the case of [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) with multiple possible results, such as when activating a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with multiple effects, failing a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) is defined as achieving less than the minimum DC for that check.)

#### **Distracting Apparition**
*Prerequisite:* **Manifest Guardian Spirit**

When you have a manifested Guardian Spirit, the Guardian Spirit also discourages your enemies and distracts them from their goals. Any enemy within 3 squares of your Guardian Spirit takes a -2 penalty to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) and a -2 penalty on attack rolls against you.

#### **Guardian Spirit**
You have a **Guardian Spirit** watching over you from the realm of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), providing you with insight and advice. Your **Guardian Spirit** might be an old mentor or an ancient member of your [Force Tradition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Tradition) who has chosen to guide your [Destiny](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny).

When you use the [Search Your Feelings](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Search_Your_Feelings) application of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) Skill, you can instead choose to consult your **Guardian Spirit**. When you do so, you learn more than just whether the results of your actions will be favorable or unfavorable; you also learn the nature of any immediate consequences, including potential encounters, and whether or not certain actions will bring you closer to achieving your [Destiny](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny). 

Additionally, you gain one bonus [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) each day (available after you rest for at least 6 hours). This bonus [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) can only be used to improve a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) or activate a [Force Technique](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Technique) or a [Force Secret](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Secret). If you do not spend your bonus [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) in a given day, it is lost at the start of the next day. 

#### **Manifest Guardian Spirit**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to have your Guardian Spirit manifest for the duration of the encounter. Your Guardian Spirit appears in any square within 6 squares of you. A Guardian Spirit occupies a space, but creatures can move through the Guardian Spirit without obstruction.

As long as the Guardian Spirit remains within 12 squares of you, you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +2 morale bonus on [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks, and a +2 morale bonus to your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). You can move the Guardian Spirit up to 6 squares as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn.

#### **Vital Encouragement**
Once per encounter, your Guardian Spirit offers you **Vital Encouragement**, urging you to press on despite adversity. As a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), you gain [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) equal to 10 + one-half your Heroic Level. Damage is subtracted from [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) first, and any [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) remaining at the end of the encounter are lost. [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) from multiple sources do not stack.
