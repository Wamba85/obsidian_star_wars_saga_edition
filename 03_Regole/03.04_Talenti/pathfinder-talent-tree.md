*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You specialize in finding and creating optimal locations from which your allies can fight, and then making sure that they reach those locales safely. In combat, you use your eye for finding secure locations to pick the best spots from which to launch your attacks.

#### **Bunker Buster**
If you are adjacent to an object that can provide you with [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from a target, you can [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) at that target as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action).

#### **Defensive Measures**
*Prerequisite:* **Safe Zone**

All enemies treat your **Safe Zone** as [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain).

#### **Enhance Cover**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate a single ally within your line of sight who has [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from one or more enemies. That ally is considered instead to have Improved [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) against those enemies until the start of your next turn as long as the ally still has [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover). 

#### **Escort Fighter**
You can spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to designate one adjacent ally. Until the start of your next turn, if you move, that ally can also move the same number of squares, provided that the ally ends its movement adjacent to you. You cannot move a distance greater than the ally's speed.

#### **Launch Point**
*Prerequisite:* **Safe Zone**

Any ally who starts his or her turn within your **Safe Zone** and then exits the **Safe Zone** gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls before the end of that ally's turn, provided that the ally is not within your **Safe Zone** when the attack is made.

#### **Obscuring Defenses **
*Prerequisite:* **Safe Zone**

Enemies that fire into your **Safe Zone** take a -2 penalty to attack rolls.

#### **Relocate**
*Prerequisite:* **Safe Zone**

You can dismiss your **Safe Zone** as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), ending its current effects. Any allies in the space your **Safe Zone** was occupying gain a +2 bonus to their Speed until the start of your next turn. When you use this Talent, you cannot create a new **Safe Zone** until the start of your next turn.

#### **Safe Passage**
*Prerequisite:* **Escort Fighter**

Once per turn, you can spend a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) to allow one ally within line of sight to move up to its speed as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). If a target makes an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) against the ally during its movement, you can make an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) against that target.

#### **Safe Zone**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can identify a **Safe Zone**, within which your allies gain certain advantages. You designate a 4-by-4 square area of the combat area as a **Safe Zone**; at least 1 square of the **Safe Zone** must be the square you currently occupy. Each ally who starts his or her turn within the **Safe Zone** gains a +2 circumstance bonus to his or her [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) and [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) until the start of the ally's next turn. The **Safe Zone** lasts until the end of the encounter, and you can have only one **Safe Zone** in effect at a time.

You can create a new **Safe Zone** as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), dismissing the old **Safe Zone** and replacing it with the new one, but no square of the old **Safe Zone** can overlap with any square of the new **Safe Zone**. You cannot create a **Safe Zone** in a space that overlaps another [Pathfinder's](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pathfinder) **Safe Zone**.

#### **Zone of Recuperation**
*Prerequisite:* **Safe Zone**

Any ally who catches a [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind) while within your **Safe Zone** regains a number of additional Hit Points equal to your Class Level.
