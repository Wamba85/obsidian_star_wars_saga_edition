*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

You are trained to work within the famed Bothan SpyNet. [The Bothan SpyNet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bothan_SpyNet) is a secret collection of organic and electronic resources and personnel spread throughout the galaxy, accessed by computer or in person.

#### **SpyNet Agent**
*Prerequisites:* [Bothan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothan), or two Talents from the [Infiltration Talent Tree](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Infiltration_Talent_Tree)

You can use your [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check modifier instead of your [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) check modifier when making [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) checks. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) skill for the purpose of using this Talent. If you are entitled to a [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) reroll, you can reroll your [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Bothan Resources**
*Prerequisite:* **SpyNet Agent**

Your status within the SpyNet gives you access to additional resources, and you know the best sources for [Restricted](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Restricted) or [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare) items. With a successful DC 20 [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check, you can purchase standard weapons, [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment), and transport services at 50% of the going rate, or [Rare](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Rare) and [Restricted](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Restricted) weapons, [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment), and transport services at 75% of the going rate.

#### **Knowledge is Life**
*Prerequisite:* **SpyNet Agent**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate a single target within line of sight and make a [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) check against a DC equal to 15 + the target's CL. If the check is successful, for the remainder of the encounter you gain a +2 morale bonus to the [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Scores) of your choice against that target.

#### **Knowledge is Power**
*Prerequisite:* **SpyNet Agent**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate a single target within line of sight and make a [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) check against a DC equal to 15 + the target's CL. If the check is successful, for the remainder of the encounter you score a Critical Hit against that target on a natural roll of 19 or 20.

If you have another ability that increases your weapon's critical range against that target (such as the [Elite Trooper's](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_Trooper) **[Extended Critical Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Extended_Critical_Range)** Talent, or the [Jedi Knight's](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Knight) **[Vaapad](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vaapad)** Talent), you increase this range by 1 (for example, from 19-20 to 18-20). However, anything other than a Natural 20 is not considered an automatic hit; if you roll anything other than a Natural 20 and still miss the target, you do not score a Critical Hit.

#### **Knowledge is Strength**
*Prerequisite:* **SpyNet Agent**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate a single target within line of sight and make a [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) check against a DC equal to 15 + the target's CL. If the check is successful, for the remainder of the encounter you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against that target.

#### **Six Questions**
*Prerequisite:* **SpyNet Agent**

You have mastered the basic [Bothan](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bothan) philosophy of Six Questions to glean more information from contacts through fewer questions. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can designate a single target within line of sight and make a [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) check against a DC equal to 15 + the target's CL.

If the check is successful, you learn a target's Character Level, [Classes](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Classes), [Ability Scores](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_Scores), and the target's available [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) and [Destiny Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Points).
