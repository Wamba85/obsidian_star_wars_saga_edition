Your attunement to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) grants you uncanny powers of perception.

#### **Force Perception**
You can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead of a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check to avoid surprise, notice enemies, sense deception, or sense influence. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) skill. If you are entitled to a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Force Pilot**
You can use your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check modifier instead of your [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) check modifier when making Pilot checks. You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) skill. If you are entitled to a [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Foresight**
*Prerequisite:* **Force Perception**

You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to reroll an [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check, keeping the better of the two rolls. Additionally, if you roll a natural 20 on the [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check reroll, you immediately regain the [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) spent to activate this talent.

#### **Gauge Force Potential**
*Prerequisite:* **Force Perception**

By focusing on a specific creature in your line of sight, you can gauge how strong in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) they are. This takes a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) and requires a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check. If your check result meets or beats the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), you know whether or not they have the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/force-sensitivity.md|Force Sensitivity]] feat, you know how many [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) they know (but not which ones specifically), and you know how many [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) they currently have.

#### **Visions**
*Prerequisites:* **Force Perception**, [*Farseeing*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)

*<sup>See also: [On the Force, Visions, and Discretion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/On_the_Force,_Visions,_and_Discretion)</sup>*

Whenever you use the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to see into the target's past or future instead of the present. You declare how far into the target's past or future you wish to look, up to a maximum of 1 year per your Character Level.

Any information gained about a target's future is subject to change, depending on whether steps are taken to alter that future.

You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select this Talent, you add your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) bonus an additional time.

#### **Instinctive Navigation**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

*Prerequisite:* **Force Pilot**

You can substitute your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill for any [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check made to [Astrogate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Astrogate) or [Use Sensors](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Sensors) while you are the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) of a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle).

#### **Motion of the Future**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

*Prerequisites:* **Force Perception**, *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can peer into the future in search of signs of danger, removing one use of the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power from your active [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) (as though you had just activated the Force Power).

Any time before the end of your next turn when you are the target of an attack or [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), you can force your attacker to reroll the attack roll (or [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check) against you, keeping the second result. This counts as using the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power against the attacker, but this Talent replaces the normal rules and effect of that Force Power.

#### **Psychometry**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisites:* **Force Perception**, *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*

When you use the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power, you can choose to target an object you hold instead of a character or creature. You can look into the targeted item's past, up to a maximum of 5 years per your Character Level.

Any information gained about the object's past is based on the thoughts and emotions of the person holding or carrying the object at the time you perceive, which can skew the results of the vision.

#### **Shift Sense**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to gain Low-Light Vision (see [Visibility](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Visibility)) for 1 minute or until the end of the encounter, whichever is longer.

## Homebrew Sense Talents

#### **Force Meld**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Jedi Padawans*

*Prerequisites:* [**Battle Meditation**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Meditation), [**Link**](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Link)

Using a meditative battle trance, Force-users are able to join their minds together, collectively becoming stronger. However, a masterful degree of will is required to prevent the participants from sharing their weaknesses as well as their strengths. 

As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can designate a number of willing allies equal to your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier within 12 squares of you. These allies must be [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill. As long as you remain within 12 squares of each other, you can [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) on attack rolls and [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

However, the characters using the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Reaction takes a -5 penalty on all [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks until the end of their next turn. Additionally, when any character participating in the **Force Meld** takes damage that exceeds their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense); all other participants take damage equal to the original damage minus their own [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). 

#### **Instinctive Astrogation**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

*Prerequisites:* **Force Pilot**

You can use your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check modifier instead of your [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check modifier to [Astrogate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Astrogate). You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) skill. If you are entitled to a [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Machine Empathy**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

You can use your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check modifier instead of your [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check modifier.

If you are entitled to a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check reroll, you may reroll your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

#### **Machine Meld**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Force Users*

*Prerequisites:* [*Technometry*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Technometry)

As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you may attempt to merge your consciousness with am adjacent complex machine such as a computer, Droid or Vehicle by treating a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check as the [Improve Access](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Improve_Access) function of the [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) skill. Failure to beat the machine's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) results in 1d4 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) damage dealt directly to your Hit Points. Success is treated as normal, though you may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) upon success to move the system's [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) an additional step. When a system is Helpful you are considered merged, and remain so until you chose to return to your natural body.

While merged you are considered helpless and unaware of your body's surroundings. However, on your turn, you are in control of the merged machine. You are able to use the [Access Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Access_Information) ability of the [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) Skill at a +10 bonus. In the case of a Vehicle or Droid, you are able to operate any single [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) or [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) system as if you were at the appropriate station, but at a +5 bonus to the associated check (attack roll or [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check)). Further, when a merged Force-user uses the [Reroute Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reroute_Power) Action, their Vehicle moves an additional +1 step up the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

Upon returning to their natural body, a Force-user suffers a -5 penalty to all [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks made for 1d4 hours for every round they spent merged, and cannot spend [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) unless accepting a [Dark Side Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Point). If the player was merged for longer than an hour, they suffer a -10 penalty to all [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) checks for 1d4 days for every hour spent merged, and cannot spend [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) or [Destiny Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_Points) unless accepting a [Dark Side Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Point).

#### **Reactive Precognition**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

Once per encounter, you may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to gain a +1 insight bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) and [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) for the remainder of the encounter, or until you are knocked unconscious.
