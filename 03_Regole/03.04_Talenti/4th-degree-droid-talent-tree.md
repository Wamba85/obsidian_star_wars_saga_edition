*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

The following [Droid Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid_Talents) may be taken by any [4th-Degree Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/4th-Degree Droid).

#### **Combat Repairs **
Once per day, as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can use the [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) Skill to repair yourself (using the [Repair Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repair_Droid) application of the Skill), as opposed to the normal 1 hour.

#### **Droid Smash **
You can use your mechanical strength when wielding a melee weapon. You add 2 x your [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) bonus to melee damage rolls when wielding a weapon in one hand.

#### **Targeting Package **
You can take two consecutive [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) in the same round to activate special targeting software. When you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls on your next attack if your target is at Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range) (or within reach for melee attacks) and within line of sight. You lose the benefit of this Talent if you lose line of sight to your target or if you take any other action before making your attack. The effect of this Talent stacks with that of the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/point-blank-shot.md|Point-Blank Shot]] Feat.

## Additional 4th-Degree Droid Talents

Once per encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can reduce the damage from a single attack that targets your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) by an amount equal to your [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense).

#### **Target Acquisition**

Once per encounter, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), designate an enemy target within line of sight as an acquired target. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for all attacks against that target until the end of the encounter, as long as the target remains within your line of sight.

#### **Target Lock**

*Prerequisite:* **Target Acquisition**

You lock onto the target designated by the **Target Acquisition** Talent. If the target leaves your line of sight, you automatically reacquire the **Target Lock** as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) if the target comes back within your line of sight. You also gain a +5 bonus to your [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) skill when opposing the target's [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) checks.

The weapon must be permanently mounted to your chassis (as a [Tool](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tool)), and it must use your internal power supply. Handheld weapons, such as [Blaster Rifles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster_Rifle), do not qualify for this Talent.
