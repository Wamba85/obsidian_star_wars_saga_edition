*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

You prowl the space lanes seeking wealth, fame, adventure, or something more. You're also pretty good with [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) in general.

#### **Hyperdriven**
Once per day while aboard a [Starship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship), you can add your Class Level as a bonus on a single attack roll, [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check), or [Ability Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ability_Check). The decision to add this bonus can be made after the result of the check is known.

#### **Spacehound**
You take no penalty on attack rolls in [Low Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Low_Gravity) or [Zero Gravity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Zero_Gravity) environments, and you ignore the debilitating effects of [Space Sickness](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Space_Sickness). In addition, you are considered proficient with any Starship Weapon.

#### **Starship Raider**
*Prerequisite: ***Spacehound**

You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls made while aboard a [Starship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship). This bonus applies to attacks made with Starship Weapons, as well as personal weapons used aboard a [Starship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship).

#### **Stellar Warrior**
*Prerequisite: ***Spacehound**

Whenever you roll a Natural 20 on an attack roll made aboard a [Starship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship), you gain one temporary [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). If the [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) is not used before the end of the encounter, it is lost. This Talent works with both [Weapon Systems](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Systems) and personal weapons used aboard a Starship.

## Additional Spacer Talents

#### **Cramped Quarters Fighting**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

*Prerequisites: ***Spacehound**, **Starship Raider**

When adjacent to an obstacle or barrier, you gain a +2 [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense).

#### **Deep Space Raider**
*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

*Prerequisites:* **Spacehound**, **Starship Raider**

Whether you are taking on military targets on behalf of a resistance movement or you are out for personal gain, you are experienced at raiding Starships and similar targets. You can use each if the following Actions once per encounter:
- *Clear a Path:* Your attack forces an enemy to alter course or move out of your way. You must be fighting aboard a [Starship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starship) to use this Action. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a ranged attack. If the attack hits, on its next turn your target must move its Speed to a square that is not adjacent to you. If the target is an enemy [Starfighter](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter) engaged in a [Dogfight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dogfight), the target instead must attempt to disengage from the [Dogfight](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dogfight).
- *Covering Fire:* You squeeze off several shots as you escape pursuing enemies. As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), if you are the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) of a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), you may move the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) up to twice its Speed and make a single ranged attack with one of the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat))-controlled [Vehicle Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapons) at any point during that movement. If you hit and deal damage to a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) with this attack, the target [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls against your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) until the end of your turn.
- *Disabling Fire:* Make a ranged attack with your [Vehicle Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapon). If you make this attack against a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) and hit and deal damage, you can choose one of the following to take effect until the end of your next turn:
    - One of the target's [Vehicle Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapons) ceases to function.
    - The target's [Shield Rating](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shield_Rating) is reduced to 0.
    - The target's Hyperdrive is disabled.
    - The target's Speed is reduced to 2 squares ([Character Scale](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Scale)).

#### **Make a Break for It**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

*Prerequisites: ***Spacehound**, **Stellar Warrior**

Once per encounter, while on or in a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), you can move up to one-half your speed, or move the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) up to one-half its speed if you are the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)), as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). This movement does not provoke [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).
