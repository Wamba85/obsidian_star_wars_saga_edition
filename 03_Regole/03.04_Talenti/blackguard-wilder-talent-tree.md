*Blackguard Wilder Talent Tree created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Dedicated warriors of [The Blackguard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Blackguard), Blackguard Wilders specialize into different roles to perform their duties. You must be a member of [The Blackguard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Blackguard) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Blackguard Initiate**
You have been trained balance [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) within yourself, holding the quaking power within you. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can grant yourself a bonus to your attack rolls equal to your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) or [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (whichever is lower). However, while this effect is active, you suffer a penalty to your [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) equal to your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score).

This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (minimum 1 round).

#### **Wilder Marauder**
*Prerequisite:* **Blackguard Initiate**

You have learned to utilize the abilities of the [Force Traditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Traditions) you study. Select one [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power); you may spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to replace a power in your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) (that has not been expended) with the chosen [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power). If you do not spend this [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) before the end of the encounter, it is lost and the replaced power returns to your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite). You may activate this Talent a number of times per encounter equal to your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (minimum 1).

This Talent may be selected multiple times. Each time you select this Talent, you must choose a different [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power).

#### **Wilder Ravager**
*Prerequisite:* **Blackguard Initiate**

You are a stalwart defender of [The Blackguard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Blackguard). As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can grant yourself a bonus to your [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) equal to your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) or [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (whichever is lower). However, while this effect is active, you suffer a penalty to your attack rolls equal to your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score). 

This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (minimum 1 round). 

#### **Wilder Trinity Assassin**
*Prerequisite:* **Blackguard Initiate**, **[Sneak Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak_Attack)**

When you would normally deal additional damage through the **[Sneak Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak_Attack)** Talent, you may choose to forgo the additional d6 of damage to instead add +4 to the damage total. The ability may be used multiple times per attack. (For example, a character that has two instances of the **[Sneak Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak_Attack)** may choose to deal +8 points of damage instead of rolling an additional 2d6.)
