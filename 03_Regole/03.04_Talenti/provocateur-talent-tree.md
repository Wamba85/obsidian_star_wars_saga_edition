*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

As a provocateur, you specialize in turning your enemies against one another, giving your allies the advantage. This is accomplished through a combination of gaining an enemy's confidence, making careful use of deception, and coordinating your allies' attacks.

#### **Cast Suspicion**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can select one enemy within your line of sight. That enemy loses all morale and insight bonuses on attack rolls and cannot be aided (using the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action) by its allies until the end of your next turn.

#### **Distress to Discord**
You encourage your allies to sow discord among your enemies by fighting with renewed vigor. Whenever an ally within your line of sight takes its [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind), all enemies within 2 squares of that ally lose their [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) bonuses to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the end of your next turn.

#### **Friend or Foe**
*Prerequisite:* **Cast Suspicion**

Whenever an ally within your line of sight is missed by a ranged attack, you can (as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), once per turn) designate one enemy adjacent to that ally. Compare the attack roll of the missed attack to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of that enemy; if the attack would hit, the attack targets that enemy and is resolved as normal.

#### **Seize the Moment**
*Prerequisite:* **Distress to Discord**

Once per turn as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), when an enemy is reduced to 0 Hit Points or is moved down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by any means, you allow one ally within your line of sight to take their [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind) immediately (as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action)).

Furthermore, when your ally takes their [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind), they regain a number of additional Hit Points equal to your Class Level.

#### **Stolen Advantage**
*Prerequisite:* **Cast Suspicion**

Whenever an enemy within your line of sight uses the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action to grant one of its allies a bonus, you can (as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction)) designate one ally within your line of sight. The enemy automatically fails to aid its ally, and the ally you designate gains a +2 bonus on its next attack roll made before the end of your next turn.

#### **True Betrayal**
*Prerequisites:* **Cast Suspicion**, **Friend or Foe**

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of one enemy within your line of sight that can hear and understand you. If your check result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that target immediately makes an attack (as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action)) against another target of your choice.

This can be a melee attack against an adjacent target or a ranged attack against a target within the attacker's Point-Blank [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). The target gains a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) if it is of a higher level than you. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.
