*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Starships of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Starships_of_the_Galaxy)*

You are skilled at commanding Starships and small fleets.

#### **Combined Fire**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you may designate a single creature, [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) or object within your line of sight as the target of **Combined Fire**. Any [Weapon Batteries](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Batteries) attacking the target deal an extra die of damage for every 2 points by which their attack roll exceeds the target's [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) (instead of every 3 points).

In addition, when using the [Tactical Fire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_Fire) option for a [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship), you may designated a weapon or [Weapon Battery](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Battery) to make a single attack.

#### **Fleet Deployment**
*Prerequisite: *[Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) 13

As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you can designate a number of [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles) equal to your [Officer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Officer) Class Level and within your line of sight. Those Vehicles may immediately move a number of squares equal to their speed.

#### **Fleet Tactics**
*Prerequisites: *[Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) 13, **Fleet Deployment**

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you may designate a single [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) as the target of a large-scale assault. If you succeed on a DC 15 [Knowledge (Tactics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Tactics)) check, all allied [Gunners](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunner) within line of sight deal 1 additional die of damage to the target with each successful ranged attack until the start of your next turn.

This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **It's a Trap!**
You are skilled at sensing the plans of enemy naval [Officers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Officer), and counteracting them. Once per encounter as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you can grant the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)) of any single [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) within line of sight (including a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) you are commanding) an immediate [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Combat).

#### **Legendary Commander**
*Prerequisites: *[Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) 13, [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) 13, **[Born Leader](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Born_Leader)**

When you are the [Commander](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Commander) of a [Capital Ship](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Capital_Ship), calculate its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) using your Heroic Level plus one-half the ship's armor bonus (rounded down), the Pilot's Heroic Level, or the ship's Armor bonus, whichever is highest.

In addition, all [Gunners](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gunner) on your ship add one-half your Heroic Level, or one-half their Heroic Level, whichever is more, to damage rolls with [Vehicle Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Weapons). Finally, you treat any generic crew as being one quality level higher (maximum of Ace, see [Crew Quality](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Crew_Quality)).
