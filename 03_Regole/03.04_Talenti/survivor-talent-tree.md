As an explorer of dangerous places, you are trained to react to danger swiftly and adroitly, as well as navigate [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain), and reduce damage.

#### **Evasion**
If you are hit by an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack), you take half damage if the attack hits you. If the area attack misses you, you take no damage. If you are the [Pilot](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pilot_(Vehicle_Combat)), this talent applies to your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle).

#### **Extreme Effort**
You can spend two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) to gain a +5 bonus on a single [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength) check or [Strength](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Strength)-based [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) made during the same round.

#### **Sprint**
When you use the [Run](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Run) action, you can move up to five times your Speed (instead of up to four times).

#### **Surefooted**
Your Speed is not reduced by [Difficult Terrain](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Difficult_Terrain).
