*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - Jedi Knights (Part 3)*

The Morgukai Cultists are a fierce society of elite Kajain'sa'Nikto warriors. The ancient order holds an intense hatred for [The Jedi](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi) of the Republic, a rigid code of honor, and a deadly fighting skill that makes them lethal adversaries for any campaign. The Morgukai are all-but extinct during the Clone Wars, however, the following Talents are suited for any era.

#### **Armored Morgukai**
*Prerequisites:* **Morgukai Resolve**, [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) 13, Proficient in Armor Worn

Morgukai warriors craft their armor from rare cortosis ore that has the unusual ability to repel [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) strikes, and they train to maximize the effectiveness of this trait. You add your armor's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) bonus as an [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to your Elite Trooper [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) (With a maximum bonus equal to your base Elite Trooper DR), a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) does not ignore your [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction).

Additionally, you add your armor's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) bonus as an [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to the reaction roll initiated by a successful [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) attack to deactivate the [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber).

#### **Cortosis Staff Block**
*Prerequisite:* [Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Cortosis Staff)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_Proficiency_(Cortosis_Staff)), [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/nikto-survival.md|Nikto Survival]] (Kajain'sa'Nikto)

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you may negate a melee attack by making a successful opposed attack roll. The DC of the attack roll is equal to the result of the attack roll you wish to negate, and you take a cumulative -5 penalty to your attack rolls to use this Talent for every time you have used **Cortosis Staff Block** since the beginning of your last turn.

You must have a [Cortosis Staff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cortosis_Staff) drawn to use this Talent, and you must be aware of the attack and not [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed). You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to use this Talent to negate an attack against an adjacent character.

#### **Morgukai Resolve**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/nikto-survival.md|Nikto Survival]] (Kajain'sa'Nikto)

Morgukai warriors have trained their minds to resist the effects of Jedi mind tricks, and as such, gain a +5 bonus to their [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) versus any [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) with the [*[Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting)*] descriptor.

#### **Multiattack Proficiency (Cortosis Staff)**
Whenever you make multiple attacks with a [Cortosis Staff](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cortosis_Staff) as a [Full Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full_Attack) Action, you reduce the penalty on your attack rolls by 2. You can take this Talent multiple times; each time you take this Talent, you reduced the penalty on your attack rolls by an additional 2.
