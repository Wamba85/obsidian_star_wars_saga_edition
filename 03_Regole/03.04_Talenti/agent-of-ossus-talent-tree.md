[The Agents of Ossus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Agents_of_Ossus) are urban Force-users who specialize in using their powers to survive in the cities and towns at the center of civilization. Their proximity to Imperial authority necessitates both discretion and creativity among their members. You must be a member of [The Agents of Ossus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Agents_of_Ossus) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Buried Presence**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to become immune to detection by [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) for 1 hour. During this time, you always avoid detection by characters who are using the [Sense Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Force) application of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill, and you cannot be the target of the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power.

You may use this as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to another character attempting to locate you with [Sense Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sense_Force) (but before the character locates you). If you make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, this Talent's effect immediately ends.

#### **Conceal Other**
*Prerequisite:* **Buried Presence**

When you use either the **Buried Presence** Talent or the **Vanish** Talent, you affect one other willing adjacent target, granting it the effect of that Talent as well. You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you do so, it increases the number of adjacent willing targets you affect by one.

#### **Insightful Aim**
*Prerequisite:* [Weapon Proficiency (Pistols)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Pistols)) or [Weapon Proficiency (Rifles)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Proficiency_(Rifles))

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to substitute your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) modifier for your ranged attack bonus when making attacks with a ranged weapon until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Vanish**
You can make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to vanish from the sight of a single target within line of sight. If the result of your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), you gain [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment) from that target until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack roll or [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) against the target.
