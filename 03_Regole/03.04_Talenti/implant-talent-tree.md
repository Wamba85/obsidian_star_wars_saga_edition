Some [Shapers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Shaper) develop Implants that can be placed quickly and easily, temporarily boosting the physical prowess of their beneficiaries.

The following Talents all grant effects that last until the end of the encounter. At the end of the encounter, any target that benefits from one or more of these Talents immediately moves -3 steps down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), and the [Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition) becomes [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent). The [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) can only be removed after 8 hours of rest, or by performing successful [Surgery](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surgery) on the target.

#### **Adrenaline Implant**
Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can give one adjacent living creature an **Adrenaline Implant**. The target must be willing to receive this Implant, which grants the target 10 bonus Hit Points at the start of each of it's turns. These bonus Hit Points do not accumulate. Damage is subtracted from the bonus Hit Points first, and any bonus Hit Points remaining at the end of the encounter go away. Bonus Hit Points from different sources do not stack.

#### **Precision Implant**
Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can give one adjacent living creature a **Precision Implant**. The target must be willing to receive this Implant, which grants the target a +1 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus on attack rolls until the end of the encounter.

#### **Resilience Implant**
Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can give one adjacent living creature a **Resilience Implant**. The target must be willing to receive this Implant, which grants the target a +5 [Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) bonus to it's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) until the end of the encounter.

#### **Speed Implant**
Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can give one adjacent living creature a **Speed Implant**. The target must be willing to receive this Implant, which increases the target's base Speed by 2 until the end of the encounter.

#### **Strength Implant**
Once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can give one adjacent living creature a **Strength Implant**. The target must be willing to receive this Implant, which allows the target to deal +1 die of damage whenever it hits with a melee attack until the end of the encounter.
