*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

You use devious tactics to capture ships and victims intact.

#### **Bloodthirsty **
You can perform a [Coup de Grace](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coup_de_Grace) as a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action). Whenever you successfully perform a [Coup de Grace](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Coup_de_Grace) Action and kill the target, all allies within your line of sight gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls for the duration of the encounter.

#### **Fight to the Death**
*Prerequisite:* **Bloodthirsty**

Once per encounter, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can fill your companions with renewed vigor. All allies within 6 squares of you heal damage equal to your Heroic Level.

#### **Keep Them Reeling**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a single melee attack against a target within [Reach](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reach). If the attack hits, you deal no damage, but your target must [Move](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move) or [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) away from you on its next turn.

#### **Raider's Frenzy **
Once per round, when one of your allies within 6 squares successfully damages a target, you grant all your allies within your line of sight a bonus to damage rolls against that target equal to one-half your Class Level until the end of your next turn.

#### **Raider's Surge**
Once per encounter, as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) or [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check (your choice) against each enemy within your line of sight. If the check result equals or exceeds the enemy's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that enemy must [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) on its next Action or take a -1 penalty on its attack rolls until the end of the encounter. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Savage Reputation**
*Prerequisite:* **Bloodthirsty**

You have cultivated a **Savage Reputation**, and when you are recognized, you instill fear in your enemies. All opponents within 6 squares of you take a -1 penalty to all their attack rolls. This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) Fear effect.

#### **Take Them Alive**
Whenever you or any of your allies within 6 squares of you reduces a target to 0 Hit Points, you can choose to treat that opponent as though they had been reduced to 0 Hit Points by [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage (and thus, remain stable).
