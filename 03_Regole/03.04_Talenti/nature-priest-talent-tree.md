*Homebrew Reference Book: [Saga Edition All-Purpose Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Saga_Edition_All-Purpose_Sourcebook)*

The Nature Priests learn how to sense the natural world, and use that knowledge to manipulate it in a way that most [Force Traditions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Traditions) do not. You must be a member of [The Nature Priests](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nature_Priests) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Thunderous Bellow**
*Prerequisite:* Bellow Species Trait

You may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) when you use your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) modifier instead of your Character Level when determining the attack bonus. Additionally, any creature or unattended object you successfully hit with this Talent, in addition to taking damage, is pushed back 1 square plus an additional square for each 5 points by which your attack roll exceeded the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense).

#### **Beast Speech**
You may speak to [Beasts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beasts) as if you shared a language. This allows you to use [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks on them without penalty (though it does not inherently change their [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude)), and allows you to exchange information or requests with them, subject to the limitations of the Beast's intelligence.

Given an area with at least a moderate amount of animal life, you may make [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) checks without paying credits, but you take a -5 on the check and are limited to information [Beasts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beasts) would be aware of. (For example, you could learn the location of an installation, but not the code that opens the door.)

#### **Commune with Nature**
If you sink into a [Force Trance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Trance) while in natural surroundings, your consciousness slips outside your body, spreading to embrace the world around you. While in this state, you become aware of the state of the natural world as you would be aware of the state of your own body.

This sense extends to a distance of one kilometer per Character Level, but does not include any areas of manufactured terrain. You become aware of the general state of the natural world within the area, as well as any disruptions to the natural order (such as pollution, fires, and powerful unnatural or non-native creatures), and any locations that are particularly strong with [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) (Light or Dark Side). You know the direction and approximate distance of these sites, but cannot pinpoint them accurately.

While you are in this state, [Beasts](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beasts) with an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) score of 2 or less have an [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of Indifferent towards you and generally ignore you, as if you were a natural part of the environment like a tree or rock.

#### **Constriction**
*Prerequisite:* *[Plant Surge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Plant_Surge)*

Creatures caught by your *[Plant Surge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Plant_Surge)* take 1d6 bludgeoning damage each round, as if damaged by a Large creature with the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/crush.md|Crush]] Feat.
