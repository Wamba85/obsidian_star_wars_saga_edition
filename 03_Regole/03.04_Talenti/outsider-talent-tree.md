*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Unknown Regions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Unknown_Regions)*

By their nature, [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) are outsiders. By blurring the line between lawful and lawless, [Scoundrels](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Scoundrels) operate outside social and cultural norms. Eventually, they learn to make the most of their positions.
#### **Oafish**
Whether you come by oafishness naturally or it is all an act, you use your lack of sophistication and finesse as an excuse to bluff your way into or out of delicate situations. Once per encounter, when you fail either a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) or a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check, you can add a bonus equal to 1d6 + your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier to your [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) or [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check result.
#### **Outsider's Eye**
*Prerequisite: *[Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception)

Your status as an outsider gives you an objective view of enemies and acquaintances. Once per encounter, you can make a DC 20 [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action). If the check is successful, you gain your choice of one of the following pieces of information:
- One [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Score) of one character or [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) within your line of sight
- The identity of the character or the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) within your line of sight that has either the lowest or highest current Hit Points
- The identity of the character or the [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) within your line of sight that has either the lowest or highest position on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
#### **Outsider's Query**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) 

You use your outsider status as an excuse for mistakes, missteps, and social offenses. If you fail a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check to change a target's [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude), the target's [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) toward you does not change. You can also attempt to change the target's [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) one additional time per encounter.
#### **Wary**
*Prerequisites:* **Outsider's Eye**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception)

Your outsider status makes you cautious, observant, and ready for action. If an enemy fails a [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) or a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check opposed by your [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check, you can take one [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). If multiple enemies fail on the same turn (such as when you detect several enemies sneaking up on you), the number of [Move Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Actions) you take cannot exceed your [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) modifier (minimum 1).
