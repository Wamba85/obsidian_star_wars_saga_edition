Your brutal fighting techniques give you an upper hand when operating in small groups.

#### **Gang Leader**
Once per encounter, when you make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate), you gain a +1 bonus on the check for every ally within 6 squares of you and in the target's line of sight (maximum +5 bonus).

#### **Melee Assault **
When you make a melee attack against a target that has one or more of your allies adjacent to it, compare the result to the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) as well as its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). If the attack hits both [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses), the attack deals +1 die of damage and the target is knocked [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone).

#### **Melee Brute**
When you make a melee attack against a target that has one or more of your allies adjacent to it, compare the result to the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense) as well as its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense). If the attack hits both [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses), the target's Speed is reduced by 2 squares and it takes a -2 penalty to its [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the end of your next turn.

#### **Melee Opportunist**
Once per encounter, when an ally makes a successful melee attack against a target adjacent to you, you can make a melee attack against that target as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), with a +2 bonus on the attack roll.

#### **Squad Brutality**
When you succeed on a melee attack against a target that has one or more of your allies adjacent to it, you may reroll your damage roll, keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Squad Superiority**
Whenever you and at least two allies are adjacent to the same target, that target is considered [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against you.
