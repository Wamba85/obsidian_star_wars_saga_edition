*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You specialize in springing ambushes on your enemies.

#### **Ambush Specialist**
If you are not [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised) on the first round of combat in an encounter, you can treat the first round of combat as if it were the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round) for the purposes of [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) and [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) that trigger only during the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round).

Additionally, during the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) you can designate a target as your Prime Target. You gain a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls against your Prime Target until the end of the encounter.

#### **Destructive Ambusher**
*Prerequisite:* **Ambush Specialist**

After you designate a Prime Target, you deal +1 die of damage on attacks against the Prime Target until the end of the encounter.

#### **Keep It Going**
*Prerequisite:* **Ambush Specialist**

If you reduce your Prime Target to 0 Hit Points, as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) you can designate another target within your line of sight as your new Prime Target. This new target remains your Prime Target until the end of the encounter.

#### **Keep Them Reeling**
*Prerequisite:* **Ambush Specialist**

Once per turn as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can make an [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check, opposed by the [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) check of your Prime Target. If your check result equals or exceeds your Prime Target's check result, your target is [Flat-Footed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flat-Footed) against all attacks you make before the end of your turn.

#### **Perceptive Ambusher**
*Prerequisite:* **Ambush Specialist**

You gain a +5 circumstance bonus to [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) checks against your Prime Target until the end of the encounter.

#### **Spring the Trap**
If you and all your allies roll higher [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) checks to start combat than do all your opponents, you automatically gain a [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round), even if the opponents are aware of you when combat begins.
