*Reference Book:* *[Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

You have learned the tricks of fighting in the gladiatorial arena. These Talents represent your knowledge of this specialized combination of combat and showmanship.

#### **Brutal Attack**
*Prerequisite:* [Weapon Focus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus) (Chosen Weapon)

Choose a single weapon with which you posses the [Weapon Focus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus) feat. Attacks with such weapons that deal damage (including doubling damage from a Critical Hit) exceeding an opponent's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) deals +1 die of damage on that attack.

You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select this Talent, it applies to a different weapon.

#### **Call Out**
*Prerequisite:* **Personal Vendetta**

When you use the **Personal Vendetta** Talent, you may designate one target of that Talent to take a -5 penalty to attacks against targets other than you, instead of the normal -2 penalty.

#### **Distracting Attack**
*Prerequisite:* **Brutal Attack** (Chosen Weapon)

When you deal damage to a target with a melee or ranged attack, compare the attack roll to the targets' [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If the attack roll also meets or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the target takes a -2 penalty to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) until the end of your next turn.

#### **Exotic Weapons Master**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/exotic-weapon-proficiency.md|Exotic Weapon Proficiency]] (Any)

You treat all [Exotic Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapons) as a single weapon group. If you already have [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) or [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) that grant you proficiency with, or augment the use of, one [Exotic Weapon](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon), those [Feats](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feats) now apply to all [Exotic Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapons). For example, if you already had [Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Shyarn)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_Proficiency_(Shyarn)), and [Weapon Focus (Shyarn)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Shyarn)), you are now proficient with, and possess the [Weapon Focus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus) Feat for, all [Exotic Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapons). 

#### **Lockdown Strike**
When you hit a moving opponent that is one size category larger than you or smaller with an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity), you immediately end its current movement.

#### **Multiattack Proficiency (Exotic Weapons)**
*Prerequisite:* **Exotic Weapons Master**

Whenever you make multiple attacks with [Exotic Weapons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapons) as a [Full Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full_Attack) Action, you reduce the penalty on your attack rolls by 2 points.

You can take this Talent multiple times; each time you take this Talent, you reduce the penalty on your attack rolls by an additional 2 points.

#### **Personal Vendetta**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can taunt all opponents within 12 squares and line of sight; on their next turn, these opponents take a -2 penalty on attack rolls made against any target other than you.

This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Unstoppable**
You can sometimes shrug off the effect of debilitating attacks. Once per encounter, if you are hit by an attack that would normally knock you down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), you can reduce the number of steps you move down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) by 1 step (to a minimum of 0).
