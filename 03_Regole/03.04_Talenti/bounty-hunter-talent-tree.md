*Reference Book: Star Wars Saga Edition Core Rulebook*

The nature of their work requires [Bounty Hunters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty_Hunters) to associate with the scum of the universe. You are among the finest [Bounty Hunters](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bounty_Hunters) in the galaxy, relying on the element of surprise and your hunter's instincts to catch your prey.

#### **Hunter's Mark**
If you [Aim](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aim) before making a ranged attack, you move the target character -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) if the attack deals damage. This Talent can be used only against characters, not objects or [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles).

#### **Hunter's Target**
*Prerequisite: ***Hunter's Mark**

Once per encounter as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action), you may designate an opponent. For the rest of the encounter, when you succeed on a melee or ranged attack against that opponent, you gain a bonus on damage equal to your Class Level.

#### **Notorious**
Your skill as a Bounty Hunter is known throughout the galaxy, even on fringe worlds. When you are not [Disguised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Disguised), you may reroll any [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) checks made to [Intimidate](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intimidate), keeping the better of the two results.

#### **Nowhere to Hide**
You may choose to reroll any [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) checks made to [Locate Individual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Locate_Individual), but you must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

#### **Relentless**
*Prerequisites: ***Hunter's Mark**, **Hunter's Target**

This Talent applies only to an opponent you've designated as your Hunter's Target. Any attack or effect originating from the target that would normally move you along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) does not, in fact, move you along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

#### **Ruthless Negotiator**
*Prerequisite: ***Notorious**

When [Haggling](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Haggling) over the price of a bounty, you can reroll your [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check, keeping the better result.

## Additional Bounty Hunter Talents

#### **Detective**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue)*

You are skilled in locating individuals and using research and surveillance to learn some of their most intimate secrets.

Make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against your target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If you equal or exceed your target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), that target takes a -5 penalty to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).

This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect. The penalty remains as long as you have line of sight to your target and immediately ends if the line of sight is broken.

To receive this information, you must have access to a computer or [Datapad](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Datapad) plus access to a network or [The HoloNet](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_HoloNet). This **Electronic Trail** does not reveal bank balances or other secret information, which requires a separate [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check.

You are fast with the binders. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), when you successfully use the [Grab](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grab) Action against a target, you can use [Binder Cuffs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binder_Cuffs) or similar restraints to bind one of the target's arms to one of your arms or to an adjacent object.

You cannot use improvised materials, such as [Mesh Tape](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mesh_Tape), for this Talent, and the binders must be in your hands or readily available. You and the target both take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) while bound together.

#### **Revealing Secrets**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue)*

*Prerequisite:* **Detective**

Your investigations reveal information that your target though was secret. When you make a [Gather Information](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Gather_Information) check to learn secret information, the DC is reduced by 10 and the bribery cost is reduced to one-fifth the original cost.

#### **Signature Item**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

You are famous for using certain items, and you have become skilled at wielding them. You select a single weapon, suit of armor, [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), or other item. While wielding that weapon, wearing that armor, piloting that [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle), or otherwise using that item, you gain a +2 morale bonus on opposed [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks).

You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you do so, you choose a new object to be your **Signature Item**. The effects of multiple **Signature Items** are cumulative with one another, increasing this morale bonus by 1 point each time.
