#### **Cover Bracing**
You can [Brace](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Brace) a weapon set on [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) as a single [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) (instead of two) if you are adjacent to an object (including walls, barriers, and [Vehicles](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicles)) that provides you with [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) from all of the target squares.

You know how to intentionally crash an opponent's moving [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle). When you successfully deal damage to a [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) by [Ramming](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ramming) it, your Vehicle takes half damage from the [Ram](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ram). Additionally, if the target [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) is the same size as your [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) or smaller, that Vehicle cannot move in the following round.

#### **Nonlethal Tactics**
When you are using a ranged weapon set to [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun), [Stun Grenades](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Grenades), [Nets](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Nets), [Riot Shields](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Riot_Shields), or [Stun Batons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Batons), you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll and deal +1 die of [Stun Damage](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun_Damage).

#### **Pursuit**
*Prerequisite:* [Dexterity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dexterity) 13

When [Running](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Running), you are not restricted to a straight line; and you can reroll [Endurance](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Endurance) checks, keeping the better of the two results, while [Running](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Running).

#### **Respected Officer**
You have a reputation that causes allies and opponents to treat you with respect. You automatically improve the [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of an [Indifferent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Indifferent) character to [Friendly](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Friendly) with no check required.

#### **Slowing Stun**
When you move a target at least -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) with an attack, its speed is halved until all conditions are removed.

#### **Takedown**
When you successfully make a melee attack and deal damage at the end of a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge), you knock your target [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) as well, provided your opponent is no more than one size category larger than you.
