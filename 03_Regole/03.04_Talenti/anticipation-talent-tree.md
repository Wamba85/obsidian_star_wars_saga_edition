*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy at War](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_at_War)*

You have studied the ways of your enemies and have learned how to read the actions and thoughts of others. You can predict what they will do, and you gain advantage over them by anticipating their every move.

#### **Anticipate Movement**
Once per round, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to an enemy within your line of sight moving, you can enable one ally within your line of sight to move up to his or her speed as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action).

#### **Forewarn Allies**
All allies within 12 squares of you gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity).

#### **Get Down**
As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), when an ally is targeted by a ranged attack, you can enable that ally to drop [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) immediately (imposing the normal -5 penalty for a ranged attack against a [Prone](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prone) target to the triggering attack roll) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action).

#### **Heavy Fire Zone**
*Prerequisite*: **Forewarn Allies**

Once per turn, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), designate a 3x3 square area within your line of sight. Until the end of your next turn, if a target moves into that area you can enable one ally within your line of sight to make an [Attack of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_of_Opportunity) against that target. The ally you choose must be armed with a Weapon capable of making [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity), and this counts toward the ally's normal limitations for [Attacks of Opportunity](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attacks_of_Opportunity) made in a round.

#### **Summon Aid**
*Prerequisite*: **Get Down**

Once per round, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), when an enemy moves adjacent to you, you can enable one ally within your line of sight to immediately make a [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack against the triggering enemy. The ally you choose must be able to [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) the enemy from his or her current square under normal [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) rules.
