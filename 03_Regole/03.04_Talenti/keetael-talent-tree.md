*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

Keetael learn to efficiently and secretly manipulate [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) in combat. Because of their long lives, they gain certain advantages when attempting to view the past through [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). You must be a member of [The Keetael](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Keetael) Force Tradition to select these Talents.

#### **Conceal Force Use**
You have learned to use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) without telltale gestures, reducing the disturbances created in the process. Whenever you make a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) you can make a [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) check to convey deceptive appearances in order to conceal the effects of your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) use.

Normal modifiers for the Deception's Complexity still apply.

#### **Force Direction**
You can use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to guide your ranged attacks to their target. Whenever you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to add to a ranged attack roll, you can always add +3 (or +4, if you roll d8s for [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points)) instead of rolling the die.

#### **Force Momentum**
You use [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to add to the impact of your melee weapon, increasing your damage. Whenever you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to add to a melee attack roll, if the attack hits you can also add the Force Point's result to the damage roll.

#### **Past Visions**
*Prerequisites: ***[Visions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Visions)*'

The long-lived [Draethos](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Draethos) are particularly adept at searching and understanding the past. When using *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* to look into the past, reduce your DC numbers by half. Also, you are able to see everything within 6 squares of your target clearly without spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point).
