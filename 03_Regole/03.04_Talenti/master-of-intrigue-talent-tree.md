*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Galaxy of Intrigue](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Galaxy_of_Intrigue)*

You are a skilled manipulator and have mastered the art of working behind the scenes to accomplish your goals. Flash and spectacle are inferior tools, only suitable for those without your unique talents.

#### **Advanced Planning**
When you roll [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) for combat, choose one willing ally within your line of sight. You and that ally swap [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) results.

#### **Blend In**
You know how to blend into a variety of cultures and groups with ease. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you gain [Total Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Total_Concealment) when adjacent to at least two other creatures. This benefit does not apply to attacks from adjacent creatures.

#### **Done It All**
When you select this Talent, choose two [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) (from any non-[Prestige Class](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Class)) that you do not possess but for which you meet the prerequisites. Once per turn on your turn, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) to gain the benefits of one of those [Talents](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talents) until the end of your next turn.

#### **Get Into Position**
Once per encounter, at the start of your first turn, choose two allies within 12 squares and in your line of sight. Each ally can immediately move up to their Speed as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

#### **Master Manipulator**
*Prerequisites*: **Advanced Planning**, **Get Into Position**

You are a master of making things happen the way you want them to. You can use each of the following Actions once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) on your turn:
- *Demand Recovery*: Select one ally within 5 squares and in your line of sight. That ally moves +5 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) and gains a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls and [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) until the end of your next turn.
- *Exceptional Control*: Roll a d20 and note the result. Once before the end of the encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can replace the result of an enemy's or ally's d20 roll with the result you rolled for this ability. The enemy or ally must be within your line of sight.
- *Word of Warning*: Select one ally within 5 squares and in your line of sight. Once before the end of the encounter, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to that ally having any [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Score) targeted by a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) or an attack, you can replace that ally's [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Score) with your same [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Score) until the attack or the [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) is resolved.

#### **Retaliation**
*Prerequisites*: **Advanced Planning**

Whenever you move down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) as a result of taking damage that equals or exceeds your [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold), the next time you hit and damage a creature or a [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) with a melee or a ranged attack before the end of your next turn, you automatically move the target -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).
