The path to [The Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dark_Side) of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) is the quick and easy path, granting amazing power but forever dominating the destinies of those in its grasp.

You must have a [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) or 1 or higher to select Talents from this Talent Tree; if your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) is ever reduced to 0, you lose access to all Talents in this Talent Tree until your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) increases.

#### **Power of the Dark Side**
You allow your hatred to fuel your attacks. Whenever you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to modify an attack roll, you may choose to roll an additional bonus die and take the best result. However, doing so increases your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.

For example, a 1st-level character with this talent could increase their [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1 to roll 2d6 instead of 1d6, taking the best die result and applying it as a bonus to their attack roll.

#### **Dark Presence**
*Prerequisites:* **Power of the Dark Side**, [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) 13

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you grant yourself and all allies within 6 squares of you a +1 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus to all [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) until the end of the encounter. These bonuses are lost if you fall unconscious or die. Affected allies that move out of range lose the benefits for as long as they remain out of range.

#### **Revenge**
*Prerequisites:* **Dark Presence**,** Power of the Dark Side**

Whenever an ally of equal or higher level than you is killed or reduced to 0 hit points within your line of sight, you gain a +2 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls until the end of the encounter. (Since [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonuses do not stack, you don't get a higher bonus if more than one ally falls in the same encounter.)

#### **Swift Power**
*Prerequisite:* **Power of the Dark Side**

Once per day, you can use a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that normally takes a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) or a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action). 

## Additional Dark Side Talents

#### **Consumed by Darkness**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

Sometimes your anger consumes you. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can take a -5 penalty to your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) to gain a +2 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) bonus on attack rolls. The penalty and bonus last until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Dark Preservation**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* **Power of the Dark Side**

Whenever an effect would normally move you down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), you may spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) and increase your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1 to negate that movement down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

#### **Dark Side Savant**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

Once per encounter as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can return one [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] descriptor to your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite) without spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point). You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select it, you can use it one additional time per encounter.

#### **Drain Knowledge**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Threats of the Galaxy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Threats_of_the_Galaxy)*

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to drain the knowledge of an opponent you touch; you must succeed on a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check (DC equal to the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense)) to activate this Talent, and if you fail to activate this Talent, you may not try again on the same target for one day. If successful, you immediately become [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in one [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) that the target is [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in; if you are already [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in that [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill), you instead gain [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/skill-focus.md|Skill Focus]] in that [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill). This effect lasts for one day. Additionally, your target moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), and the [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) can be removed only by resting for 8 hours.

Additionally, you can choose to instead sift through the mind of the target, looking for a specific piece of knowledge or information. Doing so requires you to make a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check against the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense); success indicates that you pull the relevant information from the target's mind. When you do so, you do not gain the bonus [Trained Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained_Skill) or [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/skill-focus.md|Skill Focus]] normally granted by this Talent, but otherwise the Talent functions as normal. Using this Talent increases your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.

#### **Transfer Essence**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Jedi Academy Training Manual](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Jedi_Academy_Training_Manual)*

*Prerequisite:* [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) equal to [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) Score

When you die, you become a [Dark Side Spirit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Spirit_Template) until the end of the encounter. You continue to occupy a space in this form, but other creatures can occupy the same space or move through your space without impediment. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can attempt to possess an adjacent target. You must succeed on a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check against an adjacent target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). If your check result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), you deal 8d6 points of [Stun](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stun) damage to the target; if you reduce the target to 0 Hit Points or move it to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) with this attack, you possess the target as though it were a willing host.

Alternatively, as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can transfer your essence into a single adjacent object, such as a [Holocron](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Holocron) or a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber). If you do so, you lie dormant within the object until another creature attempts to use that object, at which time you can emerge and attempt to possess the creature, as described above.

If you do not possess a creature or object within 10 rounds of manifesting as a [Dark Side Spirit](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Spirit), your spirit dissipates and ceases to exist.

#### **Wrath of the Dark Side**
*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* **Power of the Dark Side**

When you roll a Natural 20 on a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to activate a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that directly deals damage to a target, you can choose not to regain all of your spent [Force Powers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Powers) as normal and instead the targets damaged by the [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) take half that damage again at the start of their next turn.

Only Force Powers that directly damage the target are subject to this Talent, including *[Corruption](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Corruption_(Force_Power))*, *[Force Blast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Blast)*, *[Force Grip](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Grip)*, *[Force Lightning](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Lightning)*, *[Force Slam](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Slam)*, *[Force Thrust](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Thrust)* (only when spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point)), and *[Repulse](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Repulse)* (only when spending a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point)).

## Homebrew Dark Side Talents

#### **Blast of Hatred**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

*Prerequisite:* **Power of the Dark Side**

You can create balls of unnatural energy, enabling you to make a ranged attack roll against the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of one target within 12 squares and line of sight, dealing 2d6 points of energy damage to the target on a successful attack. Using this Talent increases your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.

#### **Crushing Power**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

*Prerequisites:* **Power of the Dark Side**, **Swift Power**

When using a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) that directly inflicts damage, you treat the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) as though it were 5 points lower when determining if the target moves along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

#### **Dark Dream**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

*Prerequisites:* **[Force Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Perception)**, *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)*

Whenever you use the *[Farseeing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Farseeing)* Force Power on a sleeping target, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) and extend the casting time to a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). Doing so allows you to impose nightmares upon the target in the form of present or upcoming disasters. These nightmares are disguised as premonitions in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), and can take any form you choose (such as a loved one dying in childbirth, or a betrayal by a close friend).

When the target awakens from these nightmares, he or she moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), which can only be removed by resting for 8 hours without being further interrupted by the use of this Talent. The use of this Talent increases your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.

#### **Dark Power**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Legacy of the Force Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Force_Sourcebook)*

*Prerequisite:* **Dark Side Savant**

You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to increase the result of a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check made to activate a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) with the [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] descriptor. (Normally [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) cannot be used to increase results of [*[Dark Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side)*] or [*[Light Side](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Side)*] Force Powers.)

#### **Dark Side Maelstrom**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Clone Wars Saga Edition Fan Sourcebook](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars_Saga_Edition_Fan_Sourcebook) - The Dark Side*

*Prerequisites:* At least one Talent from the Dark Side Talent Tree, [*Force Storm*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Storm), [*Hatred*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hatred)

You create a wound in [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) itself, tearing open space in a vortex of intense Dark Side energy. Use of this Talent expends the [*Force Storm*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Storm) and [*Hatred*](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hatred) Force Powers from your [Force Power Suite](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power_Suite). As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), you may make a DC 25 [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check. If the check succeeds, you create a **Dark Side Maelstrom** within your line of sight one square in size that deals 2d8 [Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force) damage to all targets within its affected area. The maelstrom can only be controlled by the creator and is capable of movement up to 6 squares per round. The maelstrom requires a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check with a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) to maintain from round to round. 

The DC to maintain the maelstrom increases by one, the damage increases by +1d8 and it expands in size by one square area each round (1-square becomes 2x2 squares, etc.). If at any time a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check fails, the maelstrom disperses immediately. If the check fails by 10 or more, the maelstrom turns on its creator, dealing damage equal to its current damage die that round. If you take damage while maintaining **Dark Side Maelstrom**, you must succeed on a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check (DC = current round DC + damage taken) to continue maintaining the Talent and prevent it from turning on its creator. 

#### **Enshroud**
*Homebrew Reference Book: [Dathomir Field Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dathomir_Field_Guide)*

*Prerequisite:* **Power of the Dark Side**

Whenever your character moves 3 or more squares in a round you gain [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment); you may choose not to use this Talent when you move.
