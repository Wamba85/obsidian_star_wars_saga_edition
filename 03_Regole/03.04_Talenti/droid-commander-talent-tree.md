*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

You have learned the quirks and intricacies of commanding [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids), and you can get the most out of even the least sophisticated basic programming.

#### **Automated Strike**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]]

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can make a DC 15 [Knowledge (Tactics)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Tactics)) check. If successful, all [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) allies able to hear and understand you gain the benefits of the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/double-attack.md|Double Attack]] Feat for one Weapon Group with which you are proficient until the end of your next turn.

#### **Droid Defense**
As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can transmit tactical information to all [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) allies that can hear and understand you, granting them a bonus equal to your [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) modifier to one of their [Defenses](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defenses) (your choice) until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Droid Mettle**
*Prerequisite:* **Droid Defense**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn, you can designate a single [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) ally within your line of sight. That [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) ally gains bonus Hit Points equal to 10 + your Class Level.

#### **Expanded Sensors**
If you or any of your [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) allies has line of sight to, and is aware of, a target, all [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) allies that can hear and understand you are also considered to have line of sight (but not necessarily line of effect) to that target.

#### **Inspire Competence**
*Prerequisite:* **Expanded Sensors**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn, you can grant one [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) ally within your line of sight a competence bonus on it's next attack roll made before the start of your next turn equal to half your Class Level. Additionally, any [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) designated as the target of your [Network Mind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Network_Mind) Class Feature is considered to have a [Heuristic Processor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor) whenever it is beneficial, even if it does not actually have a [Heuristic Processor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Heuristic_Processor).

#### **Maintain Focus**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn, you can grant all [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) allies within your line of sight the ability to take the [Recover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Recover) Action as two [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions) (instead of as three [Swift Actions](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Actions)) until the start of your next turn.

#### **Overclocked Troops**
*Prerequisite:* **Droid Defense**

You push the limits of the [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids) under your command. You can spend a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn to allow each of your Networked allies (see the [Network Mind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Network_Mind) Class Feature) to immediately move up to their Speed.

#### **Reinforce Commands**
*Prerequisite:* **Droid Defense**

When you use an ability that grants a [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) ally a morale or insight bonus, increase the value of that bonus by 1.
