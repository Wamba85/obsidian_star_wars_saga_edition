*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Rebellion Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Rebellion_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

You have learned that many enemies can be considered potential allies instead. You can recognize the telltale signs of a potential ally, and, rather than killing your enemy, you can bring him or her over to your side.

#### **Recruit Enemy**
Once per encounter when you deal damage to a living creature that is equal to or greater than the target's current Hit Points and the target's [Damage Threshold](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Threshold) (that is, when you deal enough damage to kill the target), you can use this Talent. Make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense); if your result equals or exceeds the target's [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), instead of dealing full damage, you deal half damage to the target and move it -1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

In addition, the target becomes your ally, and its [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) toward you immediately shifts to [Friendly](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Friendly). The target fights on your side until the end of the encounter, at which point it departs (or, if the GM wishes, the target might become your ally permanently and join your party). Anyone [Hostile](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hostile) to you becomes [Hostile](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hostile) to the target.

This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect. If the target is a higher level than you, it gains a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense). Enemies that cannot be bribed, blackmailed, or seduced (such as [Stormtroopers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stormtroopers)) are immune to this effect.

#### **Bolstered Numbers**
*Prerequisite:* **Recruit Enemy**

Whenever you successfully use **Recruit Enemy** on a target, you and all allies within line of sight gain a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls until the end of the encounter.

#### **Noble Sacrifice**
*Prerequisite:* **Recruit Enemy**

Whenever you successfully use **Recruit Enemy** on a target, if that target is reduced to 0 Hit Points or moved to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track), as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can grant yourself and all allies within line of sight a number of [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) equal to 10 + your Class Level.

Damage is subtracted from [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) first, and any [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) remaining at the end of the encounter are lost. [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) do not stack. No [Bonus Hit Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Bonus_Hit_Points) may be granted if you or an ally reduce the target to 0 Hit Points or move it to the bottom of the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

#### **Stay in the Fight**
*Prerequisite:* **Recruit Enemy**

If you successfully use **Recruit Enemy** on a target and that target can catch a [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind), the target can do so immediately as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction).

#### **Team Recruiting**
*Prerequisite:* **Recruit Enemy**

You can use your **Recruit Enemy** Talent whenever you or an ally would deal enough damage to kill a target, instead of only when you do.
