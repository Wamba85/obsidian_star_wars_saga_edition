*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

[The Jal Shey](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jal_Shey) concentrate on studying [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), improving their diplomacy, and applying their teachings to their trappings. You must be a member of [The Jal Shey](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jal_Shey) Force Tradition to select any of these Talents.

#### **Action Exchange**
*Prerequisite:* **Force Delay**

Whenever you successfully use **Force Delay**, you can grant one ally within 6 squares, and line of sight the ability to trade a [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) for another [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) on their next turn.

#### **Force Delay**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion)

Jal Shey verbally startle opponents with a little help from [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Once per encounter, you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of a target with an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) score of 3 or higher, that can understand you, as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction). If successful, the target loses its [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) on its next turn. If you choose to spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point), the target instead loses its [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action).

#### **Imbue Item**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to imbue a specifically crafted weapon, armor, or article of clothing with the power of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force). Imbuing the item requires a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). As a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), the wearer of such an item can open themselves to [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), transferring one of their [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) into the item. You can then use a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) to spend a stored [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) at any later time, even in the same round that you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) of your own.

You can attune only one item per 24 hours, the item functions only for you, and a given item can only store one [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) at a time. You cannot wear more than one attuned item at a time, and you can spend only up to a maximum of two [Force Points](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Points) in a round (one of your own, plus one from an imbued item).

#### **Knowledge of the Force**
You can use your scholarly knowledge of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) to help others reach their full potential. You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) ally within 6 squares on a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check, following the normal rules for the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action as usual.
