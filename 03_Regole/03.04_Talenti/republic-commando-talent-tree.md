*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

You have demonstrated that you are a highly skilled and capable soldier for the Republic and work well in a commando squad.

#### **Ambush**
When you successfully hit an opponent that has not yet acted in combat, you deal +2 dice of damage with the attack.

#### **Higher Yield**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics)

Once per encounter, you can choose to deal +1 die of damage with a single [Grenade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Grenade), [Mine](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mine), or other [Explosive](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Explosive).

#### **Rapid Reload**
You can retrieve a stored [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell) or [Power Pack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Pack) and reload your Weapon as a single [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action).

#### **Shoulder to Shoulder**
Whenever you begin your turn adjacent to an ally, you gain a number of bonus Hit Points equal to your Heroic Level. Damage is subtracted from the bonus Hit Points first, and any bonus Hit Points remaining at the end of the encounter go away. Bonus Hit Points from various sources do not stack.

#### **Strength in Numbers **
If you are within 10 squares of an ally, you can add +2 to your [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction).
