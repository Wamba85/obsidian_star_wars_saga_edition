*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Scum and Villainy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Scum_and_Villainy)*

You are a master of wielding two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols) at the same time, and can use both [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols) simultaneously in unusual ways.

#### **Dash and Blast**
*Prerequisites:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dual-weapon-mastery-i.md|Dual Weapon Mastery I]], [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/running-attack.md|Running Attack]]

Once per encounter as a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action), when you are wielding two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols), you may move up to twice your speed and make a ranged attack with each [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol). The normal penalties for attacking with two Weapons apply to these attacks.

#### **Flanking Fire**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dual-weapon-mastery-i.md|Dual Weapon Mastery I]]

Whenever you are [Flanked](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flanked) by two (or more) opponents and are wielding two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols), you can make a [Full Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full_Attack) Action as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) instead of a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action). This is provided that you target only opponents that [Flank](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Flank) you and attack at least two targets.

#### **Guaranteed Shot**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dual-weapon-mastery-i.md|Dual Weapon Mastery I]]

If you are wielding two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols) and make a single ranged attack with one of those [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols) as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), even if you miss you deal damage equal to half your Heroic Level to the target. This consumes a single shot from the weapon not making the attack, and the weapon you attack with uses as many shots required by the attack.

#### **Hailfire**
*Prerequisite:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dual-weapon-mastery-i.md|Dual Weapon Mastery I]]

When you are wielding two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols), as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action) you can make an [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) attack with one of the [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols) as though the Weapon were set to [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire), even if the [Pistol](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistol) would not normally be capable of [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire).

The normal penalties for [Autofire](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Autofire) still apply to this attack roll, and you may split the number of shots consumed between the two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols).

#### **Twin Shot**
*Prerequisites:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/dual-weapon-mastery-i.md|Dual Weapon Mastery I]], [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]]

When you are wielding two [Pistols](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Pistols), you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls when using the [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/rapid-shot.md|Rapid Shot]] feat.
