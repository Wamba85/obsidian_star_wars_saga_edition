You have been from one side of the galaxy to the other and have fought on more planets than most people visit in a lifetime.

#### **Battlefield Remedy**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury)

You have learned a variety of different ways to treat combat injuries in the field. When you succeed on a [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check to administer [First Aid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/First_Aid), the tended creature also moves +1 step on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track).

#### **Grizzled Warrior**
*Prerequisites:* **Seen It All**, **Tested in Battle**

You can draw upon your extensive battlefield experience to encourage your comrades and drive your enemies before you. You can use each of the following Actions once per encounter as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action):
- *Defy the Odds:* Make a single melee or ranged attack. You immediately gain a number of bonus Hit Points equal to your [Constitution](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Constitution) score.
- *Double the Pain:* When you use the [Aid Another](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Aid_Another) Action to provide an ally within 6 squares of you a bonus to his or her attack roll, add one-half your Character Level to the ally's damage roll if the attack is successful.
- *Guarded Assault:* Make a single melee or ranged attack. You gain a +2 dodge bonus to your [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) against all attacks until the start of your next turn.

#### **Reckless **
*Prerequisite:* **Tested in Battle**

You know from first-hand experience that victory goes to those willing to take a chance. You can add your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) bonus (minimum +1) to the damage roll when you make a successful [Charge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charge) attack.

#### **Seen It All**
*Prerequisites:* **Tested in Battle**, [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative)

You have seen more action in more places than most people know exist, and little in the galaxy gets you rattled. Any character using a Fear effect on you must roll twice, keeping the lower result on any [Skill Checks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Checks) and attack rolls.

#### **Tested in Battle**
When you catch a [Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind), you move +2 steps on the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) in addition to regaining Hit Points.
