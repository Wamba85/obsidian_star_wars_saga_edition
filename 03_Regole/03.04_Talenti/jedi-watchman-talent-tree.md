*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_Campaign_Guide)*

Jedi Watchmen are elite Jedi tasked with protecting and watching over a specific world or region of space. They seek out and destroy threats to the Republic and [The Jedi Order](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Jedi_Order). As such, they have enhanced their abilities to blend in and covertly investigate threats at their source.

All Jedi Watchmen are appointed and approved by the Jedi Council before training; many begin as Jedi Councilors. A Jedi Watchman's assignments might change, as directed by the council.

#### **Force Warning**
Allies within 12 squares can choose to reroll their [Initiative](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative) checks at the start of combat, but must keep the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

Furthermore, if any allies within 12 squares are [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised) at the start of an encounter, but you are not, you can designate a number of those allies equal to your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier (minimum 1); those allies are no longer considered [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised), and can act normally during the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round).

#### **Improved Quick Draw (Lightsabers)**
*Prerequisites:* [[03_Regole/03.05_Feat/quick-draw.md|Quick Draw]], [Weapon Focus (Lightsabers)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Lightsabers))

If you are carrying a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) (either in your hand or at your belt), you can draw the [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber), ignite it, and make a single attack during the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round), even if you are [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised). If you are not [Surprised](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprised), you can take any single Action of your choice, as normal.

Additionally, once per turn you may draw and ignite a [Lightsaber](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action) on your turn.

#### **Sheltering Stance**
*Prerequisite: ***[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** or **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)**, **Vigilance**

Whenever you are adjacent to an ally, you may use the **[Block](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Block)** or **[Deflect](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deflect)** Talents on attacks that target that ally without the need to spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point).

#### **Vigilance**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) you may designate one adjacent ally as the target of this Talent. That target gains a +1 deflection bonus to their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) as long as you remain adjacent to them. You may change the target of this Talent as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action).

#### **Watchman's Advance**
*Prerequisite:* **Force Warning*'

When acting in the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round), you and your allies can take an extra [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action). Any character can gain only one extra [Move Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Move_Action) during the [Surprise Round](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Surprise_Round), regardless of the number of characters with this Talent in your group.
