*Science Talent Tree created by Wikia user Chellewalker (formerly Wikia user Lukewarner).*

Technicians come in many stripes, and the fields of science are vast and diverse. Technicians can be experts in chemistry or xenobiology, making good use of their acquired knowledge in a variety of different fields.
#### **Bioengineering**
*Prerequisite: *[Skill Focus (Treat Injury)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Focus_(Treat_Injury))

You can make a [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check instead of a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check made to [Build Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Build_Object). You are considered [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) skill for the purposes of this Talent. If you are entitled to a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check reroll, you may reroll your [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check instead (subject to the same circumstances and limitations).

[Equipment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment) created through the use of this Talent gains the characteristics of a [Biotech Device](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Biotech_Device).

#### **Binary Mindset**
*Prerequisites:* [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) 13, Not a [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid)

You may select a single Talent whose prerequisites you meet from the [[03_Regole/03.04_Talenti/1st-degree-droid-talent-tree.md|1st-Degree Droid Talent Tree]]; you gain the benefits of this Talent and are considered to have this Talent for the purpose of satisfying prerequisites.

#### **Determine Weakness**
*Prerequisite:* **Identify Creature**

As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)) check against a DC of 10 + the CL of a single non-Droid creature. If successful, you grant all allies that can hear and understand you a bonus to their attack rolls against that creature. This bonus is equal to your [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) modifier (minimum +1), and lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

#### **Focused Research**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer)

Choose a single Knowledge Field (Bureaucracy, Galactic Lore, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, Tactics, or Technology). If you fail a [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) check with that Knowledge Field, you can spend a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action) as long as you have access to a computer network to reroll the check. You use your [Use Computer](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_Computer) skill in lieu of your [Knowledge](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge) skill, and keep the better of the two results.

You may select this Talent multiple times. Each time you select this Talent, it applies to a different Knowledge Field.

#### **Identify Creature**
*Prerequisite:* [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences))

You use your experience in xenobiology to recall a creature's traits and abilities. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can select a single non-Droid creature within line of sight and make a [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)) check against a DC equal to 15 + the creature's CL. If the check is successful, you immediately learn any two (your choice) of the following pieces of information:

- Creature's [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) or attack bonus with a particular attack
- Any one of the creature's [Defense Scores](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Scores)
- Any one of the creature's [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) modifier
- The presence of any one special quality or [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) (you choose the special quality or [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), and the Gamemaster reveals whether or not it is present)

#### **Poisoncraft**
*Prerequisite: *[Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury)

You can make a [Treat Injury](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Treat_Injury) check in place of a [Mechanics](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics) check to [Build Object](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Build_Object) to create a variety of [Poisons](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poisons), using your knowledge of specialized chemicals. When using this Talent, the Hit Point modifier for crafting is equal to the Poison's Challenge Level (for example, [Knockout Drugs](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knockout_Drugs) (CL 2) have a Hit Point modifier of x2). One dose of [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) is equal in size to a Fine object.

The complexity of a [Poison](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Poison) is determined by its Challenge Level (CL):
{| class="wikitable"
!POISON CL

!COMPLEXITY
|-
|CL 1-CL 6
|
|Simple
|-
|CL 7-CL 13
|
|Moderate

#### **Smelling Salts**
*Prerequisite: *[Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in [Knowledge (Life Sciences)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Life_Sciences)), **Poisoncraft**

You have created a simple formula allowing you to revitalize your allies. Once per encounter, as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can allow an adjacent non-Droid creature to [Catch a Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Catch_a_Second_Wind).

This Second Wind is not counted towards target's normal daily ability to [Catch a Second Wind](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Catch_a_Second_Wind), but if both are used in the same encounter the target moves -1 [Persistent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent) step down the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track) at the end of the encounter. The penalties imposed by this [Persistent Condition](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persistent_Condition) persist until the target takes at least 8 hours to recuperate, during which time the target can't engage in any strenuous activity.
