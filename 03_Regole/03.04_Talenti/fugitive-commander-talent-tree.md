*Reference Book:Â [Star Wars Saga Edition Legacy Era Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Legacy_Era_Campaign_Guide)*

When a fighting force is outmanned, outgunned, and constantly on the run, only the skill and acumen of talented officers can keep morale high and prevent desertion or surrender. Fugitive Commanders are skilled in the art of deceiving and eluding their pursuers.

#### **Disciplined Trickery**
Once per turn as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction), you allow one ally within 12 squares of you and within your line of sight to reroll one [Deception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Deception) or [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check, but the ally must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.

#### **Group Perception **
Whenever you roll a [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) check, all allies within 6 squares of you can do so as well, taking the highest result rolled by you or an ally.

#### **Hasty Withdrawal**
As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action) once per turn, you target a number of allies equal to your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) bonus (minimum 1). Each targeted ally must be within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight. Each ally you target can take the [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) Action immediately as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action). The normal rules for [Withdrawing](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdrawing) otherwise apply.

#### **Stalwart Subordinates**
When any ally within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight is targeted by a [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) against its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), the source of that [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) (whether a [Hazard](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Hazard), a creature, a [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid), or whatever) must roll the [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) twice, and take the lowest result.

#### **Stay in the Fight**
*Prerequisite:* **Stalwart Subordinates**

As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you remove one [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) or Fear effect currently affecting an ally within 12 squares of you and in your line of sight. When you do so, you also grant the target a number of bonus Hit Points equal to 10 + your Class Level.

#### **Stealthy Withdrawal **
*Prerequisite:* **Hasty Withdrawal**

When an ally [Withdraws](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraws) as a result of your **Hasty Withdrawal** Talent and ends its [Withdraw](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Withdraw) Action with [Cover](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Cover) or [Concealment](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Concealment) from any enemy target, that ally can make an immediate [Stealth](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Stealth) check to [Sneak](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Sneak) as a [Free Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Action).
