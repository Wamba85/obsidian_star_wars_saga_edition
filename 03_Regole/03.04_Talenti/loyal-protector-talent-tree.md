*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Clone Wars Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Clone_Wars_Campaign_Guide)*

*See also: [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers)*

As a result of your station, occupation, or even just your natural charisma, you can attract one or more faithful [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) who protect you from harm.

#### **Inspire Loyalty**
You gain a single [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower). Choose either the aggressive, defensive, or utility [Follower Template](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) for your follower, generating the follower's statistics based on the rules found in the [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) section. This [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower) gains one Armor Proficiency Feat of your choice and becomes [Trained](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Trained) in the [Perception](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Perception) skill. The [Follower](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Follower) must meet the prerequisites for the Armor Proficiency Feat you select.

You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you do, you gain one additional Follower (maximum of 3 [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers)).

#### **Undying Loyalty**
*Prerequisite*: **Inspire Loyalty**

Each of your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) gains the [Toughness](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Toughness) Feat.

#### **Punishing Protection**
*Prerequisites*: **Inspire Loyalty**, [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) +5

As a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) to you being damaged by an attack or a [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), one of your followers can make an immediate melee or ranged attack against the target that attacked you. Until the beginning of your next turn, any time you are damaged by an attack or [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), another one of your followers can attack that attacking target. This ability can be used once per encounter.

#### **Protector Actions**
*Prerequisite*: **Inspire Loyalty**

You and your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) have learned to work together to great effect, ensuring that you remain safe while allowing them to do their duty. You can use any of the following actions on your turn:
- *Bodyguard*: As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a melee or ranged attack against a target within [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). Until the end of your next turn, if that target damages you with an attack or [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power), as a [Reaction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reaction) you can choose to redirect the attack or [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) to an adjacent follower; the attack or [Force Power](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Power) is resolved against that ally as normal.
- *Diversion Attack*: As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a melee or ranged attack against a target within [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). If that target attacks you or one of your allies before the beginning of your next turn, you can move one of your [Followers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Followers) up to its speed directly toward that target.
- *The Best Defense*: As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a melee or ranged attack against a target within [Range](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Range). For each of your followers armed with a ranged weapon and having line of sight to the target, that target takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn.
