You have advanced training in one or more martial art form and have turned your body into a lethal weapon. Any character can practice these forms, but through dedications and perseverance you have exceeded the abilities of other beings.

#### **Flurry of Blows**
When you make multiple [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attacks as a [Full Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full_Attack) Action, you reduce the penalty to your attack roll by 2. You can take this Talent multiple times. Each time you take this Talent, you reduce the penalty to your attack rolls by an additional 2.

#### **Hardened Strike**
If you deal damage with an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack to a creature or [Droid](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droid) that has [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction), you reduce the value of that [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) by 1 until the end of the encounter. Cumulative attacks against the same target do not stack.

#### **Punishing Strike**
When you score a Critical Hit with an [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack, you can make an immediate [Unarmed](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed) attack (in addition to other effects of a Critical Hit) against a single target within reach. You can use this Talent only once per turn and only while wearing [Light Armor](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Armor) or no Armor.
