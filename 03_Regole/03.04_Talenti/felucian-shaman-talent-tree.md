*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

Felucian Shamans learn to manipulate their natural aptitude with [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force) and amplify their inherent powers in a variety of ways. You must be a member of [The Felucian Shamans](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Felucian_Shamans) Force Tradition to select any of the Talents described below.

#### **Charm Beast**
You may use a [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check in place of a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check when attempting to change the [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of an undomesticated creature with an [Intelligence](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Intelligence) of 2 or less. Additionally, you do not take the normal -5 penalty on the check if the creature can't speak or understand your language.
#### **Command Beast**
*Prerequisite:* **Charm Beast**

Whenever you manage to shift the [Attitude](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Attitude) of a [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) to Indifferent or Friendly, you may treat that creature as a domesticated animal- but for you only (it remains undomesticated in its response to other creatures). Additionally, you may use this [Beast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Beast) as a [Mount](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mount), as per the [Ride](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Ride) skill, provided that it is at least one size category larger than you and has a comfortable place for you to sit.

#### **Detonate**
*Prerequisite:* *[Force Blast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Blast)*

When you use the *[Force Blast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Blast)* Force Power, you can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to compare the result of your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check to the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of all other characters, creatures, and [Droids](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Droids) within 2 squares of your target. If you exceed the [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense) of those secondary targets, they also take damage from the *[Force Blast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Blast)*, and if you fail to exceed their [Reflex Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Reflex_Defense), they take half damage instead.

This is considered to be an [Area Attack](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attack) against the secondary targets (but not against the original target).

#### **Hive Mind**
You can use the [Telepathy](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Telepathy) application of the [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) skill as a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), and you automatically succeed (no roll required) if your target is a willing recipient on the same planet.

#### **Infuse Weapon**
You can spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to infuse an unpowered melee weapon (one that does not require an [Energy Cell](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Energy_Cell)) with the strength of [The Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/The_Force), making it resistant to the attacks of other Weapons. Infusing the weapon takes a [Full-Round Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Full-Round_Action).

From that point forward, when you wield the weapon, its [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction) is doubled, and [Lightsabers](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsabers) do not ignore the weapon's [Damage Reduction](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Reduction). When you spend a [Force Point](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Point) to modify the attack roll of an **Infused Weapon**, you also add 2 x the Force Point's result to the damage roll if the attack succeeds.

#### **Sickening Blast**
*Prerequisite:* *[Force Blast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Blast)*

When you use the *[Force Blast](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Force_Blast)* Force Power, if your [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force) check exceeds the target's [Fortitude Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Fortitude_Defense), you can choose to move the target -1 step along the [Condition Track](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Condition_Track). Doing so increases your [Dark Side Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Side_Score) by 1.
## Homebrew Felucian Shaman Talents

#### **Skullblade Mastery**
*Skullblade Mastery Talent created by Wikia user LilLiteralist.*

You treat a [Felucian Skullblade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Felucian_Skullblade) as a [Simple Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_Weapon_(Melee)) instead of as an [Exotic Weapon (Melee)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Exotic_Weapon_(Melee)). Additionally, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with a [Felucian Skullblade](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Felucian_Skullblade). This Talent counts as the [Weapon Focus (Felucian Skullblade)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Felucian_Skullblade)) feat for the purpose of satisfying prerequisites.

If you also have the [Weapon Focus (Simple Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Simple_Weapons)) feat, the attack bonus provided by this Talent does not stack with the attack bonus provided by [Weapon Focus (Simple Weapons)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Focus_(Simple_Weapons)).
