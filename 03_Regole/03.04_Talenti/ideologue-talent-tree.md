*Reference Book: [Star Wars Saga Edition Force Unleashed Campaign Guide](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Saga_Edition_Force_Unleashed_Campaign_Guide)*

Your zeal and dedication to your cause is inspirational. It motivates your allies and demoralizes your enemies.

#### **Instruction**
Once per encounter, as a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can boost the competence of one of your allies within 6 squares. That individual gains the ability to make a single [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) using your Skill modifier (except [Use the Force](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Use_the_Force)); this [Skill Check](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Check) must be made before the end of the encounter, or the benefit is lost.

You can select this Talent multiple times. Each time you do so, you gain one additional use of this Talent per encounter.

#### **Idealist**
*Prerequisite*: [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) 13

Your confidence empowers you, giving you the ability to withstand the harmful influence of others. You can add your [Charisma](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Charisma) modifier in place of your [Wisdom](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Wisdom) modifier to your [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense).

#### **Know Your Enemy**
You are well versed in the strengths and weaknesses of the enemies of your cause. As a [Swift Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Action), you can select a single enemy within line of sight and make a [Knowledge (Galactic Lore)](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Knowledge_(Galactic_Lore)) check against a DC equal to 15 + the target's CL. If the check is successful, you immediately learn any two (your choice) of the following pieces of information:

- Target's [Base Attack Bonus](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Base_Attack_Bonus) or attack bonus with a particular weapon
- Any one [Defense Score](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Defense_Scores)
- Any one [Skill](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Skill) modifier
- The presence of any one [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) or [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat) (you choose the [Talent](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Talent) or [Feat](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Feat), and the Gamemaster reveals whether or not it is present).

#### **Known Dissident**
*Prerequisite*: **Know Your Enemy**

You are a well-know opponent of a large and influential government or organization (such as the Empire or the Corporate Sector Authority). Officials of any level are loath to take action against you, lest they inadvertently promote your cause. As a [Standard Action](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Action), you can make a [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check against the [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense) of a single opponent within line of sight that can hear and understand you.

If the [Persuasion](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Persuasion) check succeeds, that opponent may not attack you or any [Vehicle](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle) you occupy until the start of your next turn. If the target is of higher level than you, it gains a +5 bonus to its [Will Defense](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Will_Defense), and the target must be able to hear and understand you. If the target is attacked, the effect of this Talent ends.

This is a [Mind-Affecting](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Mind-Affecting) effect.

#### **Lead by Example**
Your bravery and skill inspires others to follow your lead. Once per encounter when you successfully deal damage to an enemy, you can choose to grant all allies a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and +1 die of damage on non-[Area Attacks](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Area_Attacks) against that target for the remainder of the encounter.
